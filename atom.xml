Explore the various ways <strong>how to pause Life360</strong> outside the app itself.</p><h3 id="Pause-Life360-From-Android-Settings"><a href="#Pause-Life360-From-Android-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Pause Life360 From Android Settings"></a>Pause Life360 From Android Settings</h3><p>First, navigate to your Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo’s <strong>Settings</strong>. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a <strong>Force Stop</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>By selecting <strong>Force Stop</strong>, you temporarily halt the app’s function without uninstalling it. This operation stops location sharing until you open the app again.</p><h3 id="Pause-Life360-From-iOS-Settings"><a href="#Pause-Life360-From-iOS-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Pause Life360 From iOS Settings"></a>Pause Life360 From iOS Settings</h3><p>To <strong>pause the Life360 location</strong> on iOS, you’ll have to open the Settings app on your iOS device. Browse through your apps and select Life360. Alternatively, you can use the search bar and type “Life360”. Once in the app’s menu, change location services to <strong>While Using</strong> the App. Thus, it will not share your location unless you open the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-03.jpg"                      alt="life360 ios settings"                ></p><h3 id="Pause-by-Using-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Pause-by-Using-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Pause by Using Airplane Mode"></a>Pause by Using Airplane Mode</h3><p>This can be done from the quick settings panel on both Android and iOS devices. Turning on <strong>Airplane Mode</strong> disables all wireless connections, including cellular data and GPS, effectively pausing Life360. The great thing is that Life360 will only show your last known location to your circles. It will not say that “location services are off,” unlike the first two methods.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-04.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode ios"                ></p><h3 id="Pause-by-Uninstalling"><a href="#Pause-by-Uninstalling" class="headerlink" title="Pause by Uninstalling"></a>Pause by Uninstalling</h3><p>Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location.

Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Honor Magic 5.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates.

Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.</p><p>Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Infinix Hot 40 device and recheck it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat.

What Snapchat is using your location for?</h2><p>Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.</p><p>With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-2.jpg"                      alt="your Bitmoji on SnapMap"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-people-want-to-hide-fake-location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-people-want-to-hide-fake-location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The Smartphone and app developers are now aware of this. As a result, most Smartphone platforms are adding tools that allow users to share their whereabouts with others. Apple has its native Find my friends for their iPhone. The app works great for a group of iOS users, but you may need to share location with Android devices, which the built-in app can’t help you with. When you want to use the “find friends” app, they certainly need to add people from Android and iPhone users. And, you can’t dictate what people are choosing as their smartphone platform.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3.

This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Infinix Note 30 Pro.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Itel P55 5G.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates.

You can’t just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Itel P55 5G apps into believing that you are actually at that location.</p><p>Users don’t even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:</p><p>Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Itel P55 5G to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your Itel P55 5G location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.</p><p>To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your Itel P55 5G. But you can only do this only 3 times for free. Also, this trick works on any iPhone running on iOS 12 and older.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Use-Location-Faking-App-from-Google-Play-Android-Specific"><a href="#Part-4-Use-Location-Faking-App-from-Google-Play-Android-Specific" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Select the icon that looks like a paperclip and choose the Location option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/select-location-option.jpg"                      alt="choose the Location option"                ></p><p>3. There you will see the “Share Live Location” option and then continue. The GPS will automatically pin down your current location, and you will get an option to select the duration for which you want to share the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/pin-your-location.jpg"                      alt="Share Live Location"                ></p><p>Specify the period and continue you begin the sharing.</p><p>And that’s how you pin a location. If at some point, you decide that you don’t want to share your location, then you can stop it manually.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-a-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-Location-On-both-Android-and-iPhone-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-3-Use-a-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-Location-On-both-Android-and-iPhone-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.</p><p>Designated Safe Zones</p><p>Set up safe zones such as home, school, or work, where location sharing is on. You can change your location on Life360 outside these zones. And turn off sharing for privacy while providing reassurance during crucial times.</p><p>Time-Based Sharing</p><p>Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.</p><p>Location Bubble</p><p>Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-your-location-on-life-360-12.jpg"                      alt="life360 bubble feature"                ></p><p>Open Communication</p><p>Talk with your family about your concerns about location sharing.

But it’s crucial to value trust in relationships. Instead of resorting to faking your location, consider responsible alternatives.</p><p>But of course, there are certain situations in which you will need to fake your location.

Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With this professional GPS tool, you teleport your Viber location to anywhere in the world with a simple mouse click.</p><p>It’s compatible with Android&#x2F;iOS devices and boasts a simple-to-understand map. Interestingly, you can walk or drive to your new location and even stop between destinations to make it more believable. It’s nothing complex!</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><strong>Key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location:</strong></p><ul><li>Compatible with all Android and iOS versions.</li><li>Teleport Viber location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Walk or drive to your new Viber location.</li><li>Simulate Viber movements with custom speed.</li><li>Works with <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Facebook, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Viber, etc.</li></ul><p>Steps to change Viber location with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a <strong>fake GPS on Telegram</strong>? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a <strong>Telegram fake GPS</strong> quickly and easily. Let’s learn!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?"></a>Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:</p><h3 id="1-Protect-your-privacy"><a href="#1-Protect-your-privacy" class="headerlink" title="1. Protect your privacy"></a>1. Protect your privacy</h3><p>While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.</p><h3 id="2-Prank-your-friends"><a href="#2-Prank-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Prank your friends"></a>2. Prank your friends</h3><p>Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.</p><h3 id="3-Make-new-friends"><a href="#3-Make-new-friends" class="headerlink" title="3. Make new friends"></a>3. Make new friends</h3><p>As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the “People Nearby” feature will match your new GPS location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use -</strong> Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.</li><li><strong>Price –</strong> Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.</li><li><strong>Security –</strong> XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.</li><li><strong>Versatility –</strong> XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.</li></ul><h2 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h2><p>When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools.

You can’t just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your ZTE Nubia Flip 5G apps into believing that you are actually at that location.</p><p>Users don’t even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:</p><p>Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your ZTE Nubia Flip 5G to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your ZTE Nubia Flip 5G location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.</p><p>To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your ZTE Nubia Flip 5G. But you can only do this only 3 times for free.

This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Why Fake Location on Telegram?"></a>Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:</p><h3 id="1-Protect-your-privacy"><a href="#1-Protect-your-privacy" class="headerlink" title="1. Protect your privacy"></a>1. Protect your privacy</h3><p>While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.</p><h3 id="2-Prank-your-friends"><a href="#2-Prank-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Prank your friends"></a>2. Prank your friends</h3><p>Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.</p><h3 id="3-Make-new-friends"><a href="#3-Make-new-friends" class="headerlink" title="3. Make new friends"></a>3. Make new friends</h3><p>As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the “People Nearby” feature will match your new GPS location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

To use this feature, you don’t have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.</p><h3 id="Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map"><a href="#Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map" class="headerlink" title="Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?"></a>Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?</h3><p>Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won’t update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.</p><h3 id="Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location"><a href="#Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?"></a>Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?</h3><p>While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone’s GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.</p><h3 id="Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?"></a>Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?</h3><p>Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile &gt; Settings &gt; See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you’ll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You’ll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can’t find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can’t spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world.

Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Infinix Note 30 VIP.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates.

You can’t just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Xiaomi Redmi K70 apps into believing that you are actually at that location.</p><p>Users don’t even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:</p><p>Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your Xiaomi Redmi K70 location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services.

Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base.

First, even though you’ll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won’t be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area.

You can’t just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Xiaomi Redmi K70E apps into believing that you are actually at that location.</p><p>Users don’t even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:</p><p>Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Xiaomi Redmi K70E to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your Xiaomi Redmi K70E location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option.
