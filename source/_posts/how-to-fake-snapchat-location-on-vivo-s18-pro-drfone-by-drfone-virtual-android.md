## How to Fake Snapchat Location on Vivo S18 Pro

In this case, you can either turn off the location sharing feature or even fake your Snapchat location. Trust me - with the help of a Snapchat location spoofer, you can easily do it and that too without jailbreaking/rooting your phone. In this post, I will share these tips to fake GPS for Snapchat like a pro!

## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?

Needless to say, if someone has our real-time location access, then they can easily track us. Therefore, if you are concerned about your security or privacy, but can't turn the feature off, then you can use a Snapchat spoof hack. This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.

## Part 3: How to Fake Snapchat Location on iPhone without Jailbreaking it?

Now when you know the different scenarios to spoof location on Snapchat, let's get into some details. Ideally, you can implement a Snapchat fake location hack on both iOS and Android devices. If you own an iOS device, then you can take the assistance of a reliable application like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Without the need to jailbreak your device, it can spoof your Vivo S18 Pro location to anywhere in the world.

## Part 4: How to Fake GPS for Snapchat on Android?

Unlike iPhone, it is pretty easy to fake GPS on Snapchat map for Android devices. This is because there are plenty of fake GPS apps on the Play Store (which is not allowed on the App Store as of now). Though, before you use these apps, you need to make some changes on your Vivo S18 Pro. Here's how you can fake Snapchat location on an Android without rooting.

1. Firstly, you need to unlock your Vivo S18 Pro and visit its Settings > About Phone to tap the "Build Number" feature 7 times straight. After this, you can easily access the Developer Options on your Vivo S18 Pro.

1. Great! Once it is enabled, you can go to its Settings > Developer Options and turn on the feature to mock location on the Vivo S18 Pro device.

1. Now, you can just go to the Play Store and install any reliable fake GPS app on the phone (like Lexa or Hola fake GPS). Later, you can go back to its Settings > Developer Options and let the installed app mock location on your phone.

1. That's it! Now you can simply launch the installed fake GPS app and enter the name/address of the place to spoof your device location. Your location would automatically be changed on all the installed apps (including Snapchat).

### Conclusion

There you go! Now when you know how easy it is to use a Snapchat location spoofer, you can change your location on the app like a pro. While Android users have plenty of options to perform a Snapchat spoof on their device, iPhone users have to be a bit cautious. There are only a handful of tools like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can fake Snapchat location without jailbreaking your device. Go ahead and explore these solutions to protect your location on Snapchat or prank your friends without causing any harm to your phone.



## How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On Vivo S18 Pro

Snapchat users are very fond of using custom filters when sharing content on the app. It is a great way to ensure that your images and videos are only viewed by the people that you target. However, a new feature called Geo-filters has brought a lot of mixed feelings amongst Snachatters.

The filter is location-based, which makes any content that you share to be seen by people who are within your geographic fence.

Imagine that you are standing at the Niagara Falls and want to share with people who are in Europe; you will not be able to do this and this is why the filters are problematic to people in the Snapchat community.

Thankfully, there are ways in which you can spoof our device, allowing you to access Geofilters anywhere in the world. Today, you learn several ways in which you can achieve this objective with ease.


## Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us

Snapchat comes with a lot of filters, both sponsored and crowdsourced, which you can use to interact with different people. When Geofilters was introduced, it meant that you could only access filters that were designed for specific locations.

Sponsored filters generally tend to target people in certain areas, and this can limit how you disseminate your content on Snapchat.

The main benefit that you get from faking Snapchat is getting access to these filters without even moving an inch.

When you spoof your device, Snapchat thinks that you are actually in the area that you have spoofed to. This virtual location will then allow you to access the filters that are available in that area.

## Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak

One of the best ways to fake Snapchat without jailbreak is to use XCode. This is an app on your Vivo S18 Pro that allows you to tweak certain aspects of the apps that you have on your device, including Snapchat.

Get XCode on your device and then launch it. Start by using the locations that are found to setup XCode. You can download XCode from Apple App Store. You will need your Apple ID and password to use XCode.

![Choose a location from XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-1.jpg)

Here are the steps that you have to follow:

**Step 1: Start by creating a basic single-view application**

Launch XCode and then create a new project

![Create a new project in XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-2.jpg)

Then choose the option marked “Single View iOS application.

![Choose the ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-3.jpg)

Now customize the project options and give it any name that you desire.

![Name the project as you wish](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-4.jpg)

Now proceed and customize the Organization Name and the Identifier. The identifier works like a reverse domain name so you can use anything you desire.

Proceed and select swift as your preferred language and then click on “iPhone” as your device so the app will be small.

Any other options below this should be left in their default states.

Now go ahead and save the project to a location on your computer. Since the version control does not apply in this case, make sure that you uncheck the option before you save the app.

![Save your app](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-5.jpg)

**Step 2: transfer and run the created app on your iOS device**

People who do not have the latest version of XCode will run into the error shown below.

![Error for older XCode versions](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-6.jpg)

**IMPORTANT:** do NOT click on “Fix Issue” until you do the following tasks:

- Access the preferences on your XCode
- Choose the accounts tab
- Click on the add (+) icon at the bottom left side of your screen
- Now choose “Add Apple ID”.
- Type in your Apple ID and password

You should now have an accounts screen similar to the one shown in the image below.

![Error solved screen](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

Now close the window and click on the “team” dropdown menu. You may now select the Apple ID that you just created.

Now you can go ahead and click on the “Fix Issue” button.

Now the error will be resolved and you should have a screen that is similar to the image below.

![Correct options in XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

You may now run the app that you created before on your iOS device.

Use an original USB cable to connect the iOS device to your computer.

Towards the top right-hand corner of your screen, click on the button that is displaying your project name and then click on the iOS device.

![Run the app on the iPhone](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

Now your iOS device will be showing at the top. Select it and proceed.

![select your iOS device in the app ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

Hit the “Play” icon that is found at the top left side of your screen.

Wait for the process to be complete. You might as well get a cup of coffee as this can take quite a while.

![Wait for the process to be complete](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

When the process is complete, XCode will install the app on your iOS device. You will get the following error if your device has not been unlocked; unlocking the iOS device will put off the error message.

![XCode error for locked iPhone](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

Now you should be viewing a blank screen on your iOS device. Do not worry; your device has not been ruined. This is the app that you have just created and installed. Pressing the “Home” button will dismiss the blank screen.

**Step 3: It’s time to spoof your location**

Go to Google Maps or iOS maps which will now show your current location.

Go to XCode and then choose "Simulate Location" from the "Debug" menu and then select a different location to test.

![simulate your new location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg)

If you have done all that you need to do, then the location of your iOS device should instantly jump to the location that you have chosen.

![New location on iOS maps and Google Maps](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg)

Now you can proceed and see if you have access to Geo-filters in the new location.

**Step 4: Spy Geo-Filters on Snapchat**

Now you can launch Snapchat and then access the filters in the area that you have teleported to. Remember that you can move from one location to the next on XCode without having to close Snapchat. Just cancel the current snap after changing the location and create a new snap to see the filters in the new location. If this fails to respond, then go back to Google maps or iOS map app and then ensure that you are in the desired location. Once you have done so, close Snapchat and restart it again, and you will be in the new location once more.

## Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak

You can also fake your Snapchat GPS location using a premium app such as iTools. This is a popular application, used to spoof many other apps that require geo-location data to work. Another point to note is that the latest iPhone models cannot be jailbroken. The iOS version today is very secure and you cannot tweak it like before.

Thankfully, you can use a premium, not free, iTools to change your virtual location without jailbreaking the Vivo S18 Pro device. You can get iTools on a trial basis, but after the period expires, you will have to pay $30.95 to continue using it.

**Step 1:** Download and install iTools on your computer and then launch it. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the original USB cable that came with the Vivo S18 Pro device.

**Step 2:** Go to the iTools panel and click on “toolbox”.

![Select Toolbox in iTools](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** Select the Virtual Location button within the Toolbox Panel

![select Virtual Location in Toolbox](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Type in the location that you want to teleport to and then click on ‘Move Here”.

![Select your desired location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-3.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now open your Snapchat and you will be able to access the filters found in the location that you typed in.

Once you are finished with this spoofed location, you can simply select “Stop Simulation” in iTools. This is a premium tool, but very simple to use. It is the best tool to use, especially if you are having a device with the latest iOS version.

![stop simulation after you have finished with the new location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-4.jpg)

## Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location

From the steps used in both methods, it is very clear that iTools is the best app to use to fake your Snapchat GPS location for several reasons. Here are some of them:

- **Ease of use -** Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.
- **Price –** Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.
- **Security –** XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.
- **Versatility –** XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.

## In conclusion

When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools. There are various benefits that you gain from teleporting using these tools, with Geo-Filters access being the biggest benefit. If you want to use Snapchat all over the world without moving out of your home, then these are the ways that you can go about it.

## How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Vivo S18 Pro

![Snapchat interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-1.jpg)

Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location. It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location. Now, this is where you need the Snapchat spoof location app. You not only can hide your actual location from Snapchat. Instead, cast a fake location on Snapchat map, and eventually, you can easily access the badges/filters at your convenience!

Sounds interesting, right? Let’s understand more about the tutorials on how to hide/fake location on Snapchat map.

## Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?

Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.
