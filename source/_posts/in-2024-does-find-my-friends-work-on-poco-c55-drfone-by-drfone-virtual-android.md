## Does find my friends work on Poco C55

Find my friends app is becoming a norm for most people. The Smartphone and app developers are now aware of this. As a result, most Smartphone platforms are adding tools that allow users to share their whereabouts with others. Apple has its native Find my friends for their iPhone. The app works great for a group of iOS users, but you may need to share location with Android devices, which the built-in app can't help you with.

While some prefer Android, many of us are dedicated to the iPhone too. Therefore, if you need to keep track of the real-time location of your family members or friends, you need the assistance of a third-party tool. These apps are the most logical way to create a link to find my friends app for Android and iPhone.

What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don't even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.

### Conclusion

Remember, there are several other find my friends apps in the app store, which can entice you. Some of them have pretty neat features. But, they can drain your battery too fast; others can be pretty limited on their free version. And, many of find my friends apps are partial to either iPhone or Android. But, why not try them out yourself? Everybody’s needs and tastes are different. Give my three favorite find my friend apps for Android and iPhone a try, if they suit you, great. If not, there are more options. Find one for you and keep a "leash" on your loved ones!

## Change Location on Yik Yak For your Poco C55 to Enjoy More Fun

Yik Yak has to be one of the most controversial social media applications. First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.

Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities/states. So keep reading if you've been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today's guide, we will share the best ways to **change the Yik Yak location** and connect with people from different corners of the world.

## Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak

If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here's what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.

Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.

Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.

## Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak

So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone's GPS sensors to detect the current location, you'll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:

### 1\. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities

As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.

However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you'll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won't be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.

### 2\. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location

If you are looking for an effective way to change your location in Yik Yak, we recommend using a professional GPS simulator like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It's a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you'll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

Apart from Yik Yak, you can also use a tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to manipulate GPS signals in other location-based apps like Pokemon Go or Tinder. It's a great way to meet people from other cities on dating apps, as any geo-restrictions won't bind you.
