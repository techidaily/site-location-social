## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?

Needless to say, if someone has our real-time location access, then they can easily track us. Therefore, if you are concerned about your security or privacy, but can't turn the feature off, then you can use a Snapchat spoof hack. This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.

## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Realme C53

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Realme C53?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Realme C53 **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Realme C53s.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Realme C53.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Realme C53, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Realme C53's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Realme C53 device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Realme C53 is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Realme C53 is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 2: How to Stop Somebody Spying Using mSpy on the phone?

If someone has installed mSpy on your device, you can easily control the process. This section will mention the complete process of stopping mSpy on your device.

Below we have mentioned the complete processes of removing mSpy from your Realme C53 and iPhone device. There are two ways that you can use to remove this app from your devices

### Q1: Is it possible if someone remotely install surveillance software on My Realme C53?

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Realme C53 device in advance. Some remote spying apps will allow you to track the location of an iPhone, but you'd require the user's iCloud login and password to enable the tracking of the Realme C53 device. Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

### Q2: Can Someone Spy on You When your Phone is Off?

Sadly yes. According to What Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said in a 2014 interview that the NSA could listen to and spy on conversations using the microphone on a smartphone, even if you turn off your devices. It makes it by using spyware that prevents your smartphone from actually turning off.

### Q3: Can Someone Read My WhatsApp Chats on My Cell Phone?

Sadly, yes. While it isn't possible on iOS devices, apps can intercept your WhatsApp messages on Android devices due to the operating system's sandboxing security.

### Q4: What Other Forms of Spyware Are There?

Other forms of Spyware include keyboard loggers, Adware, browser hijackers, and modem hijackers.

## To Wrap it up

In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, when the world is connected through one device, almost everybody shares an undercurrent of worry. That is, is someone spying on me through my devices or not? And as much risky and fatal as this can be for a person who does not know if he is being tracked or not, there are solutions one can employ to safeguard himself. This article was all about how to detect and how to remove mSpy on iPhone and Android. Hopefully, now you are well aware of the different methods with their steps.

**The Best VPNs for YouTube**

Aside from NordVPN, there are other VPNs you can try to access content on YouTube, including ExpressVPN, CyberGhost, and Surfshark.

[**NordVPN**](https://nordvpn.com/)

NordVPN utilizes up to 5,200 servers in 60 countries, with some servers optimized for ultra-fast streaming. It's one of the fastest VPNs available today, where you can unblock geo-restricted content wherever you are, with a no-logs policy for unbreakable encryption.

[**ExpressVPN**](https://www.expressvpn.com/)

Like NordVPN, ExpressVPN optimizes speed for downloading and streaming. It uses more than 3,000 servers in more than 90 countries to provide cutting-edge connectivity, which includes 256-bit AES encryption for perfect anonymity.

[**CyberGhost**](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/)

CyberGhost has over 7,000 servers in more than 80 countries to unblock geo-restricted content across YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more. CyberGhost doesn't keep logs of your activities as well, ensuring your activity is safe.

[**Surfshark**](https://surfshark.com/)

Lastly, Surfshark is another reliable VPN to unblock restricted content on YouTube and other platforms. It uses up to 3,200 servers in 65 countries to provide a high-speed and low-latency connection at all times. Surfshark has a no-logs policy like the three VPNs on the list, making your online activity safe and anonymous.

Here's a handy table to compare the best VPNs available today in terms of ratings, number of servers, supported devices, prices, and more.

|  | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | CyberGhost | Surfshark |

### Method 3: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a Proxy Server

Using a Proxy to mask your location on the internet allows you to change your country on YouTube to access blocked content. In this example, we'll use [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php) to view locked YouTube content. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

![use proxfree youtube proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-proxy.jpg)

**Step 2**: On the **Server Location** dialogue box, choose a country in the available options on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Enter the **URL** of the specific video you want to see unblocked and click **PROXFREE** to open YouTube in the proxy's tab.

![unblock youtube using proxfree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/unblock-youtube-proxfree.jpg)

_**Note**: You can also use YouTube's search bar once YouTube's tab is open on your proxy to search YouTube videos as usual._

### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the Realme C53 device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.
