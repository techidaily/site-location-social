## Change Location on Yik Yak For your Apple iPhone XS to Enjoy More Fun

Yik Yak has to be one of the most controversial social media applications. First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.

Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities/states. So keep reading if you've been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today's guide, we will share the best ways to **change the Yik Yak location** and connect with people from different corners of the world.

## Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak

If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here's what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.

Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.

Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.

## Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak

So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone's GPS sensors to detect the current location, you'll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:

As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.

However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you'll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won't be able to react to them.

It's a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you'll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

It means you'll be able to publish your own Yik Yak posts from different locations and react to someone else's posts without interruptions.

## Part 3: FAQs about Yik Yak

### _2\. Does VPN work with Yik Yak?_

Yes, a VPN can be used with Yik Yak. However, it's not possible to change GPS location with a VPN.

### Conclusion

Whether you use Yik Yak for fun or have gotten addicted to its anonymity, changing your GPS location on the platform will allow you to expand your social circle and meet strangers from other parts of the world. However, there's no direct way to **change location on Yik Yak**. You'll have to use geo spoofing software such as Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to do the job. The teleport mode feature will make it quite convenient to manipulate your GPS location and access new posts on Yik Yak.
