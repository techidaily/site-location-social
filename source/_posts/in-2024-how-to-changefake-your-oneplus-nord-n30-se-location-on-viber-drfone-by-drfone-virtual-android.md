## Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion.

Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your OnePlus Nord N30 SE as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.
