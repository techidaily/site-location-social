## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Vivo S17e as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.

**Step 3:** Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.

**Step 4:** Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.
