Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location.

This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location.

If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.

- The site tends to fall on the pricey end of the spectrum in terms of its offered services.

### 3\. Spokeo

Spokeo is another helpful option if you want to find someone with just a name on the internet. You can use Spokeo to obtain people’s social media profiles, dating services, addresses, and more. For example, follow the steps below to **find people on Tinder** using Spokeo:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and launch the official search page of Spokeo. Enter the name you have in the search bar and hit the “Search Now” button.

**Step 2:** Spokeo will search across its database and present you the profiles that match your name, along with links to their social or dating profiles, if any. You can see if it yields your desired results.

#### Pros

- Spokeo offers affordable prices and some free basic searches for its users.
- It is an easy-to-use platform with an interactive UI that does not require technical information.
- The sign-up process on Spokeo is quick and time-savvy.

#### Con

- The results on Spokeo are limited to residents of the United States of America.

## Method 4: Search the Name on Other Social Media

If none of those mentioned above methods successfully locate your specific person’s Tinder profile, there are high chances that the user is not using Tinder. But don’t worry, there are still other platforms you can try to find someone using just their name.

The world of social media provides a strong and impactful platform for users. With more than half of the world’s population now using different social media sites, there is high hope that you can find your person there.

You can search across different social apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., to see if you can locate your special someone. In addition, you can check profile pictures and refine your searches to increase your chances of finding the correct result.

### Notice

If the name you are searching for is incorrect, or if they spell their name differently than you thought, looking for them on social media will not prove fruitful. Even in today’s digitalized era, some people stay away from online social platforms. In that case, your efforts will all be in vain.

### Conclusion

With the success of social media platforms and online dating services sweeping the world across its feet, nobody can remain anonymous anymore. As a result, you may find people’s profiles by knowing their names, which is undoubtedly good news for introverts with tons of pressure regarding their dating lives.

With the methods mentioned above, you can now **find someone on Tinder** by their name quite easily. These methods can prove effective when you feel like you hit it off with someone but forgot to take their contact information. Try these methods now and find your presumed love interest on Tinder effortlessly.
