![life360 location map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-01.jpg)


## Part 1: What Is Life360 and How To Pause Life360 From the App

Life360 is not just an app; it’s a digital lifeline connecting people with their loved ones. It’s primarily designed for family and close friends. By offering real-time location sharing, it ensures that members of your “Circle” (a group within the app) know where you are at any given moment. This feature is handy for parents monitoring their children’s whereabouts or friends coordinating meet-ups.

### The Purpose of Life360

At its core, Life360 is about safety and connectivity. The app includes features like location history, driving reports, and even crash detection, making it a versatile tool for modern families. It provides several benefits, like:

- **Safety assurance**. Knowing the whereabouts of your loved ones, especially in emergencies, can be invaluable.
- **Convenience**. Planning gatherings or ensuring a family member has arrived safely at a destination becomes more manageable.
- **Emergency response**. The app can alert users to potential emergencies involving Circle members.

### Reasons of Pausing Life360

However, there are instances where learning **how to pause Life360** becomes necessary:

- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.
- **Privacy**. Sometimes, you might want some privacy about your location. Thus, some people would like to pause their Life360 location sharing.

### Methods To Pause Life360 From the App

Now, the question is, **can you pause your location on Life360?** Pausing Life360 can be done for a specific circle or the entire app. This section will show you some general steps to pause your location for the app. You can do it only for a specific circle or the whole app. Here’s how you can do those.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

![location sharing life360 menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-02.jpg)

#### Pausing the Whole App

Regarding this method, pausing the location sharing for all your circles usually involves going through your phone’s **S ettings** and disabling location services for Life360. If you don’t want to do that, you can turn off location sharing for all your circles through the steps provided above.

By understanding and utilizing these features wisely, you can maintain your connection with your loved ones while managing your digital boundaries and battery health effectively. Remember, the aim is to balance connectivity with personal needs.

## Part 2: How To Pause Life360 From Settings

Life360 offers flexibility within its app and through your device’s settings. Understanding how to use these options can provide additional control over location sharing. Explore the various ways **how to pause Life360** outside the app itself.

### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

First, navigate to your Motorola Edge 40 Pro’s **Settings**. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a **Force Stop** button at the bottom of the screen.

By selecting **Force Stop**, you temporarily halt the app’s function without uninstalling it. This operation stops location sharing until you open the app again.

### Pause Life360 From iOS Settings

To **pause the Life360 location** on iOS, you’ll have to open the Settings app on your iOS device. Browse through your apps and select Life360. Alternatively, you can use the search bar and type “Life360”. Once in the app’s menu, change location services to **While Using** the App. Thus, it will not share your location unless you open the app.

![life360 ios settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-03.jpg)

### Pause by Using Airplane Mode

This can be done from the quick settings panel on both Android and iOS devices. Turning on **Airplane Mode** disables all wireless connections, including cellular data and GPS, effectively pausing Life360. The great thing is that Life360 will only show your last known location to your circles. It will not say that “location services are off,” unlike the first two methods.

![airplane mode ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-04.jpg)

### Pause by Uninstalling

Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location. The beauty of this method is that it won’t automatically notify your circles or remove you from them. However, some members might notice that your location updates are unavailable.

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion. Whether conserving battery, seeking privacy, or temporarily disconnecting, these methods provide a way to **pause Life360** **location** without drawing unwanted attention. Remember, communicating with your Circle members about your need for privacy to maintain trust is always a good idea.

So, without wasting much time, here's how to spoof Facebook location on PC:

Step 1. Launch the Facebook app on your web browser and tap your profile icon.

Step 2. Here, click Edit details under the Intro section. After that, you'll land on the Posts window by default.

## Method 2: Change Facebook Location on Android phone

Unlike the strict iPhones, Android allows you to install a third-party app to change the GPS location of your device and Facebook, to be precise. This means you don't need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you'll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US) app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap. Let's see how to do that:

Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.

Step 2. Next, "allow mock locations" in your Android's developer settings. To do that, open **Settings** >**Additional Settings** >**Developer options**. Then, click "**Select mock location app**" before choosing **Fake GPS**.

![fake gps on facebook settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-02.jpg)

Step 3. Now go to the Fake GPS location app and choose a new location for your device. If satisfied, tap **Ok** to save the added area you'd like your device to appear on.

Step 4. Finally, head to Facebook and change your location settings.

## Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook

Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you're in a particular location when in reality, you're not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It's a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.

So, below is **how to fake location on Facebook** with the Check-In feature:

Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the "**What's on your mind**" field.

Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You'll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.

![fake address and tap gps icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg)

Step 3. Now write whatever is on your mind and add the location to your latest post. It's that easy!

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It's an all-in-one software that provides multiple solutions for your Motorola Edge 40 Pro or Android phone.
