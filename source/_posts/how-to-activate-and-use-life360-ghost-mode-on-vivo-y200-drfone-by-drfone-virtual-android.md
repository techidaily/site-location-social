## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Vivo Y200 in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you‚Äôre one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let‚Äôs learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you‚Äôll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you‚Äôll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you‚Äôre actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.
