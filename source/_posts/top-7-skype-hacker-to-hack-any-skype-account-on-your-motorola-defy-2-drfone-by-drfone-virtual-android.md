![cydia app download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic21.jpg)

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic22.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you are sure about your location, change the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic23.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then, right at the end of this bottom line, you will find an 'i' icon. Click on that and then go with the wishlist. There you can choose the apps that can access your virtually changed location. Then Click on 'Done' when you are finished.
