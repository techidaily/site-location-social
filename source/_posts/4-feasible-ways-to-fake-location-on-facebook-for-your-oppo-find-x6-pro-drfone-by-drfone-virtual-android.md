## 4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Oppo Find X6 Pro

There are many reasons to **fake location on Facebook**. For example, you may want to hide your ideal address and protect your safety. Also, you might want to change the Facebook location to get better search results for products, friends, groups, and so on. But whichever the case, creating a **fake GPS on Facebook** is relatively easy. So, in this post, I want to introduce you to several methods to spoof your Facebook location quickly and easily.

## Method 1: Spoof Facebook Location on Computer

You can easily fake your Facebook location by spoofing the town or city in the profile settings. This way, anyone who views your profile bio will see your new Facebook location.

So, without wasting much time, here's how to spoof Facebook location on PC:

Step 1. Launch the Facebook app on your web browser and tap your profile icon.

Step 2. Here, click Edit details under the Intro section. After that, you'll land on the Posts window by default.

Step 3. Now tap the **Pencil** icon to change the current city/town. You can also change your hometown, relationship status, and when you joined Facebook.

Step 4. Finally, tap the **Save** button, and Facebook will automatically update your current location. To see if the changes have been applied, tap the **About** tab to see your new profile.

**Note:** Although you can successfully change your bio, Facebook will still access your actual location. Now this means your Facebook recommendations and adverts will still be based on your locality. So, keep reading to learn other reliable ways to spoof your Facebook location.

## Method 2: Change Facebook Location on Android phone

Unlike the strict iPhones, Android allows you to install a third-party app to change the GPS location of your device and Facebook, to be precise. This means you don't need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you'll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US) app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap. Let's see how to do that:

Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.

Step 2. Next, "allow mock locations" in your Android's developer settings. To do that, open **Settings** >**Additional Settings** >**Developer options**. Then, click "**Select mock location app**" before choosing **Fake GPS**.

## Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook

Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you're in a particular location when in reality, you're not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It's a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.

So, below is **how to fake location on Facebook** with the Check-In feature:

Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the "**What's on your mind**" field.

Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You'll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It's an all-in-one software that provides multiple solutions for your Oppo Find X6 Pro or Android phone.

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among todayâs generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesnât want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Oppo Find X6 Pro as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

### 2.2. Pin a Location in WhatsApp Location Service

#### 2.2.1 Merits & Demerits

The live location sharing feature in WhatsApp is introduced to give your close ones an idea of your location even when you are constantly moving. The biggest merit of this feature is that it allows the users to track the person's location long after it was shared.

But sometimes, the user shares the live location even when they want to share a fake location on WhatsApp. This really ruins your plan if you are planning to give someone a surprise or doing something special for them.

#### 2.2.2 How to Pin a Location in WhatsApp

The live location feature is entirely optional, and it depends on whether you want to use it. The process to pin a location is pretty simple. If you want to send a fake location on WhatsApp, then you might need some help. But it is easy to pin your live location.

1\. Launch WhatsApp on your phone and open the chat with the person you want to send your location.

2\. Select the icon that looks like a paperclip and choose the Location option.

![choose the Location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/select-location-option.jpg)

3\. There you will see the "Share Live Location" option and then continue. The GPS will automatically pin down your current location, and you will get an option to select the duration for which you want to share the location.
