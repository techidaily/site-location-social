### 1.2 Change Skout Location on iOS using Cydia

Another way to get the Skout location changed is through Cydia. Cydia is basically a platform that allows you to install the applications that are not validated by Apple. However, you will need to jailbreak your device in order to go ahead.

**Limitations:**

- As we have mentioned above, one of the biggest disadvantages of using this way is that you will have to get your device jailbroken. And no doubt the other limitations will also be related to this.
- While using this method, your device may end up getting bricked. So, be sure if you really wish to use this method.
- Lastly, the method can make your device vulnerable to malware and other malicious apps.

If you are still comfortable using Cydia to change Skout location, let us move on the steps.

## Part 2: Change Skout Location on Android with a Spoofer App

If you are an Android user and wondering how to change your location on Skout, all you need is a spoofer app. You can get a lot of options from Play Store. However, one of the popular apps that can be relied upon is Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer Free. This app doesn’t require rooting if your device is having Android version 6 and more. You can easily create routes with this app. Let us know how this works.

### Step by Step Guide to change Skout location via FakeGPS Go

**Step 1:** Before you get the app installed it is important to turn on the developer options firstly. And to do this, all you need is to go to the “Settings” in your device and tap on “About Phone”.

**Step 2:** You will see a “Software Info” option. Tap on it and scroll to the build number. Tap on it 7 times and you will see the developer options getting enabled on your device.

**Step 3:** As we are using Android, you need to head to the Google Play Store and look for the app on it. Now, install and then open it to proceed.

**Step 4:** While the app is launched, tap on the “ENABLE” option located at the bottom.

![enable mock location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/enable-mock-location.jpg)

**Limitations:**

- No matter spoofing is fun, but you need to be a little careful. In case it gets detected by the company, your account may get banned as this is against the policy of any app.
- The process of using the spoofer app to change Skout location can seem to be difficult and complex.
- Some apps require you to root your device in order to let you proceed with spoofing properly.
- When you spoof your location with the app too frequently, this may make your profile under suspicious activity monitoring.

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Poco C65 as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.

**Step 3:** Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.

**Step 4:** Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.
