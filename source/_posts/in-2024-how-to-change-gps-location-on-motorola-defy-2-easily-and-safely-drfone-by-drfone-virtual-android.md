The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Motorola Defy 2 in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let’s learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

## Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?

We are here to provide the three most-used methods for you to change location on Telegram. Not every solution is suitable for every situation that everyone encounters, but there is always one that is right for you. Some methods may require the assistance of a computer, some can be done only on a mobile phone, and the success rate varies greatly. Now let’s learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.

### Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android/ iOS with the best Location Changer

### Method 3: Fake location on Telegram from free on Android

It’s absolutely okay to operate on a thin budget these days. So, if you’re after a free VPN service for Android, use a [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US). It’s a free program that allows you to spoof your GPS location on Android with a few screen taps. Let’s have a look!

Step 1. Fire up Play Store and search for “fake GPS location.” You’ll see a yellow emoji holding a phone. Install that app!

Step 2. Next, open **Additional Settings** and choose **Developer options** on your phone. Then, set Fake GPS location as the mock location app.

Step 3. Now launch the app and choose your new GPS location. If satisfied, simply tap the green **Play** button.

## Part 3. FAQs About Creating a Fake GPS on Telegram?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a “red pin” on the address. The actual location doesn’t.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn’t as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can’t just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### Conclusion

There you go; you can now create a new Telegram location to prank your friends or make new circles using a premium VPN service like ExpressVPN. However, VPN monthly subscriptions can empty your wallet. So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!
