### Final Words

See, there's nothing complex about the WhatsApp live location not updating issue. Just edit and restart the app or check your location settings if it's enabled. And, of course, use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to share a fake location on WhatsApp and perform other WhatsApp tasks like backing up and transferring data. Thank me later!
