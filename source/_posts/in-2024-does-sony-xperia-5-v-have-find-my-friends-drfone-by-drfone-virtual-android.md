### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Sony Xperia 5 V **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Sony Xperia 5 Vs.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Sony Xperia 5 V.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Sony Xperia 5 V, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Sony Xperia 5 V's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Sony Xperia 5 V device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Sony Xperia 5 V is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Sony Xperia 5 V is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 2: How to Stop Somebody Spying Using mSpy on the phone?

## Part 3: How to Tell if Your Cell Phone is Being Tracked FAQ

### Q1: Is it possible if someone remotely install surveillance software on My Sony Xperia 5 V?

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Sony Xperia 5 V device in advance. Some remote spying apps will allow you to track the location of an iPhone, but you'd require the user's iCloud login and password to enable the tracking of the Sony Xperia 5 V device. Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

### Q2: Can Someone Spy on You When your Phone is Off?

Sadly yes. According to What Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said in a 2014 interview that the NSA could listen to and spy on conversations using the microphone on a smartphone, even if you turn off your devices. It makes it by using spyware that prevents your smartphone from actually turning off.

### Q3: Can Someone Read My WhatsApp Chats on My Cell Phone?

Sadly, yes. While it isn't possible on iOS devices, apps can intercept your WhatsApp messages on Android devices due to the operating system's sandboxing security.

### Q4: What Other Forms of Spyware Are There?

Other forms of Spyware include keyboard loggers, Adware, browser hijackers, and modem hijackers.
