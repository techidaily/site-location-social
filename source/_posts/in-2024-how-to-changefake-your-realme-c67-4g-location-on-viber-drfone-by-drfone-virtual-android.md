So, read on to learn how to **fake location on Viber** with some simple solutions.

## Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?

If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.

But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Realme C67 4G/Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send. But fret not because this post will help you **disable or enable My Location on Viber** according to your needs.

## Part 2: How to disable or enable My Location on Viber?

So, without wasting too much time, let’s find out the steps to disable/enable Viber location-sharing feature. It’s straightforward.

## Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?

So, is it possible to **Viber's fake location**? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one.
