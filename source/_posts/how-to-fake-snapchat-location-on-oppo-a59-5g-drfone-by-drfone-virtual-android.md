## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

### 1.Can my friends see if I use Facebook Dating?

It is one of the many advantages of using Facebook dating. It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don't expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don't expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.

### 2\. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?

If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person's photo or hitting the love icon. Let's elaborate on how you do either of the two.

**Sending a Like**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the love icon to send the like.

**Starting a conversation**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.

It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.

### 3\. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?

One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users' profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.

That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that's a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn't mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.

### 4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?

Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn't support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.

### 5\. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?

Seeing someone's Facebook Dating profile can be a daunting task. Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can't expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.

### Conclusion

In addition to that, you can also use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake your location when using other social media platforms, games, and dating sites.

But fret not, weâre glad to bring you a detailed tutorial with which you can easily perform location spoofing on Snapchat and that too, without jailbreaking your Oppo A59 5G.

Step 2: Setup GIT on Xcode

1. On the upcoming screen, Xcode will throw up a pop-up message stating âPlease tell me who you areâ and some GIT commands that you need to execute.

    ![Setup GIT](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Note:** Change the values for â<you@example.com>âand âyour nameâ with your information.

Step 3: Move Bitmoji

Now, youâre all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the âDebugâ menu and then opt for âSimulate Locationâ from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and youâre done.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Oppo A59 5G. Hereâs all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the âfake GPSâ app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Oppo A59 5G to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the âFakegps freeâ app for Snapchat. This app doesnât require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, youâll be asked toâENABLE MOCK LOCATIONSâ. Hit on it and youâll be redirected to theâDeveloper optionsâ screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the âSelect Mock Location Appâ option and opt for âFakeGPS Freeâ from the list of options appearing.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the âSearchâ icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the âplayâ button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
