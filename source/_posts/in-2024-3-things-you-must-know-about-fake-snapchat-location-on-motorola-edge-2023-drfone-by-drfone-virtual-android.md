- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Motorola Edge 2023.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

In contrast, profile location is your public location that other users can see when visiting your profile. Therefore, changing your country setting will not impact your original profile location unless you make a change yourself.
