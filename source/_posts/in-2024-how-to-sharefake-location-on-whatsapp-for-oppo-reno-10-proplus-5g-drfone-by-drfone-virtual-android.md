### What is the Difference between My Profile Location and My Country Setting on Twitter?

Country setting and profile location are both entirely different things. The country setting determines what trends and news will be displayed on your discovery page.

In contrast, profile location is your public location that other users can see when visiting your profile. Therefore, changing your country setting will not impact your original profile location unless you make a change yourself.

## Part 2: How to Fake Location on Twitter

In this technological era, changing your location to the other end of the world is just a few clicks of tasks; various software is available on the market, such as Dr.Fone, which can easily spoof your location.

Dr.Fone – Virtual Location is a well-recognized software compatible with iOS and Android devices. It can easily change your area to your desired country in a few clicks without risking your privacy.

### Why Do We Need to Fake Location on Twitter?

There are several reasons people want to learn how to change location on Twitter. Some of the reasons are mentioned below:

#### For Privacy Protection

Almost all social media platforms use your IP address and location to provide you with a genuine experience. Still, many people do not wish to risk their privacy, and for that reason, they use software and tools to fake their location.

#### For Tricking Friends and Family

You can spoof your location to prank or trick your friends and family into thinking that you're on vacation or taking a trip when you're not.

#### For Making New Friends

One of the reasons people prefer to spoof their location is to socialize and make friends with people other than their region; it's the most innovative way by which you can easily have a chat with anyone from around the world without revealing your actual location.
