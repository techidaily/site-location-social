- No matter spoofing is fun, but you need to be a little careful. In case it gets detected by the company, your account may get banned as this is against the policy of any app.
- The process of using the spoofer app to change Skout location can seem to be difficult and complex.
- Some apps require you to root your device in order to let you proceed with spoofing properly.
- When you spoof your location with the app too frequently, this may make your profile under suspicious activity monitoring.

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.

**Step 3:** Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.

**Step 4:** Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.

## The benefits of setting up a customized location on LinkedIn

Changing and setting a customized location on your LinkedIn profile can be beneficial in several ways, as listed below.
