## Part 1. What Does Life360 Ghost Mode Mean?

**Life360 Ghost Mode** is a workaround and not an official feature. It’s an unofficial term for those who hide or spoof their GPS location within the Life360 platform.

- Ghost Mode is activated using external tools to conceal or manipulate your GPS location within the Life360 app.
- It’s a workaround to gain an added layer of privacy. It allows you to control the visibility of your real-time location on the Life360 map.
- Unlike turning off the internet or your phone, Ghost Mode involves more nuanced methods. It ensures discreet location management.
- Turning off the internet or the phone displays a clear “No Network” or “Phone Off” message. Ghost Mode provides a different status indication to make your Life360 look normal.

Now that you know all of **Life360 Ghost Mode updates** and their significance, let’s explore the steps to enable it. Learn how to activate Ghost Mode within the Life360 app by using a dedicated tool.
