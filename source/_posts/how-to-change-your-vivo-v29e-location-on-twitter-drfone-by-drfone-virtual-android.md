### 1.Can my friends see if I use Facebook Dating?

It is one of the many advantages of using Facebook dating. It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don't expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don't expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.

### 2\. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?

If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person's photo or hitting the love icon. Let's elaborate on how you do either of the two.

**Sending a Like**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the love icon to send the like.

**Starting a conversation**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.

It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.

### 3\. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?

One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users' profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.

That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that's a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn't mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.

Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn't support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.

Find my friends app is becoming a norm for most people. The Smartphone and app developers are now aware of this. As a result, most Smartphone platforms are adding tools that allow users to share their whereabouts with others. Apple has its native Find my friends for their iPhone. The app works great for a group of iOS users, but you may need to share location with Android devices, which the built-in app can't help you with. When you want to use the "find friends" app, they certainly need to add people from Android and iPhone users. And, you can't dictate what people are choosing as their smartphone platform. While some prefer Android, many of us are dedicated to the iPhone too. Therefore, if you need to keep track of the real-time location of your family members or friends, you need the assistance of a third-party tool. These apps are the most logical way to create a link to find my friends app for Android and iPhone.

### 2.3 Glympse

What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don't even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.
