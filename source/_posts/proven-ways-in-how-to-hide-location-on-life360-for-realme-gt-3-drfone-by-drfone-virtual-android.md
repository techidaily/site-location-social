## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

In 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live Location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the Location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

#### 2.1.1 Merits & Demerits

When sending locations on WhatsApp, the process is quite simple to comprehend. However, a complete set of reasons explains this process's merits and demerits. When looking for them in a particular place, using location features on WhatsApp greatly helps. While in an emergency, sharing location with your loved ones is the best way to keep yourselves safe.

On the other hand, sharing location on WhatsApp can sometimes put your life at risk if it falls into the wrong hands. Whenever you share a location on WhatsApp, it directly uses your device's location services. This, in turn, utilizes the battery, which can lead you to face battery drainage problems.

#### 2.1.2 How To Send Location on WhatsApp?

As you've learned some essential merits and demerits about sharing locations on WhatsApp, provided below is a comprehensive step-by-step guide. Look through the steps to know more about the easy way of sharing live location with your loved ones:

1\. As you open WhatsApp and lead into the respective chat, select the "Attachment" or "+" icon according to your device. Continue to choose the "Location" option from the list.

2\. This leads you to a new screen that shows your location status. Look for the "Search" bar on the top and type in the location you want to send. Observe the search results and tap on the location to send it to the individual.

### 2.2. Pin a Location in WhatsApp Location Service

#### 2.2.1 Merits & Demerits

The live location sharing feature in WhatsApp is introduced to give your close ones an idea of your location even when you are constantly moving. The biggest merit of this feature is that it allows the users to track the person's location long after it was shared.

But sometimes, the user shares the live location even when they want to share a fake location on WhatsApp. This really ruins your plan if you are planning to give someone a surprise or doing something special for them.

#### 2.2.2 How to Pin a Location in WhatsApp

The live location feature is entirely optional, and it depends on whether you want to use it. The process to pin a location is pretty simple. If you want to send a fake location on WhatsApp, then you might need some help. But it is easy to pin your live location.

1\. Launch WhatsApp on your phone and open the chat with the person you want to send your location.

2\. Select the icon that looks like a paperclip and choose the Location option.

![choose the Location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/select-location-option.jpg)

3\. There you will see the "Share Live Location" option and then continue. The GPS will automatically pin down your current location, and you will get an option to select the duration for which you want to share the location.

![Share Live Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/pin-your-location.jpg)

Specify the period and continue you begin the sharing.

And that’s how you pin a location. If at some point, you decide that you don’t want to share your location, then you can stop it manually.
