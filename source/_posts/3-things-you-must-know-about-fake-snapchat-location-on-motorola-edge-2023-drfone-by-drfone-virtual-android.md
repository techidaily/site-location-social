![click get started option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3:** Now, you will be able to check your current actual location of yours on the map. After this, you need to activate the “Teleport mode”. This will be the third icon located on the right side of the screen.

You will now be able to check the new location whenever you click the “Center On.”

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Motorola Edge 2023.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

**Step 7:** Open the app now and set the desired location. Tap on the “Play” button, and you’re good to go.

## Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.

Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Motorola Edge 2023 device and recheck it.

## Conclusion

Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat. But you must always prefer to choose the right one that could perfectly meet your needs. And it could provide you with the best experience of using Snapchat without any difficulty.

## Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat

### Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!

### Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?

The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don't have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.

### Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?

Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won't update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.

### Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?

While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone's GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.

### Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile > Settings > See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you'll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You'll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can't find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.

### Wrap it Up

Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can't spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world.
