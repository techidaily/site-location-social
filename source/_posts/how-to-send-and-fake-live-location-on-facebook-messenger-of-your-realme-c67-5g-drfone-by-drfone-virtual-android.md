There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Realme C67 5G?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Realme C67 5G.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Realme C67 5G, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Realme C67 5G's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Realme C67 5G device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Realme C67 5G is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Realme C67 5G is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 2: How to Stop Somebody Spying Using mSpy on the phone?

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Realme C67 5G device in advance.

Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

### Q2: Can Someone Spy on You When your Phone is Off?

Sadly yes. According to What Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said in a 2014 interview that the NSA could listen to and spy on conversations using the microphone on a smartphone, even if you turn off your devices. It makes it by using spyware that prevents your smartphone from actually turning off.

### Q3: Can Someone Read My WhatsApp Chats on My Cell Phone?

Sadly, yes. While it isn't possible on iOS devices, apps can intercept your WhatsApp messages on Android devices due to the operating system's sandboxing security.

### Q4: What Other Forms of Spyware Are There?

Other forms of Spyware include keyboard loggers, Adware, browser hijackers, and modem hijackers.

### Method 2: Change Location on YouTube Using a VPN

The simplest and most effective way to unblock restricted content on YouTube is by using a VPN. In this example, we'll be using [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/pricing/) to change your location on YouTube using a VPN. Here are the steps.

**Step 1**: Download and install NordVPN. Sign in or create an account.

![use nordvpn to change country youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/nordvpn-signin.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use **Quick Connect** or connect to a specific country by clicking on the pin on the map. You can click on **Search here** as well to find a specific server in the country of your choosing. There's also a list of countries at the left sidebar so you can choose a server manually.

![use nordvpn quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/nordvpn-quick-connect.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open YouTube and browse previously blocked content.

**The Best VPNs for YouTube**

Aside from NordVPN, there are other VPNs you can try to access content on YouTube, including ExpressVPN, CyberGhost, and Surfshark.

[**NordVPN**](https://nordvpn.com/)

NordVPN utilizes up to 5,200 servers in 60 countries, with some servers optimized for ultra-fast streaming. It's one of the fastest VPNs available today, where you can unblock geo-restricted content wherever you are, with a no-logs policy for unbreakable encryption.

[**ExpressVPN**](https://www.expressvpn.com/)

Like NordVPN, ExpressVPN optimizes speed for downloading and streaming. It uses more than 3,000 servers in more than 90 countries to provide cutting-edge connectivity, which includes 256-bit AES encryption for perfect anonymity.

[**CyberGhost**](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/)

CyberGhost has over 7,000 servers in more than 80 countries to unblock geo-restricted content across YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more. CyberGhost doesn't keep logs of your activities as well, ensuring your activity is safe.

[**Surfshark**](https://surfshark.com/)

Lastly, Surfshark is another reliable VPN to unblock restricted content on YouTube and other platforms. It uses up to 3,200 servers in 65 countries to provide a high-speed and low-latency connection at all times. Surfshark has a no-logs policy like the three VPNs on the list, making your online activity safe and anonymous.

Here's a handy table to compare the best VPNs available today in terms of ratings, number of servers, supported devices, prices, and more.

|  | NordVPN | ExpressVPN | CyberGhost | Surfshark |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Method 3: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a Proxy Server

Using a Proxy to mask your location on the internet allows you to change your country on YouTube to access blocked content. In this example, we'll use [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php) to view locked YouTube content. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

![use proxfree youtube proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-proxy.jpg)

**Step 2**: On the **Server Location** dialogue box, choose a country in the available options on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Enter the **URL** of the specific video you want to see unblocked and click **PROXFREE** to open YouTube in the proxy's tab.

![unblock youtube using proxfree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/unblock-youtube-proxfree.jpg)

_**Note**: You can also use YouTube's search bar once YouTube's tab is open on your proxy to search YouTube videos as usual._

### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the Realme C67 5G device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

![unblock youtube using smart dns](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/surfshark-smartdns.jpg)

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299" border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.
