## How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)

Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here's the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don't even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.

## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Business awareness**

Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

- **Make new friends**

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger

After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let's now know how to do that with easy steps. You don't need third-party help to **mock live locations on Messenger on Android** or iPhone. That's because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:

Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.

Step 2. Click the "four dots" at the bottom-left corner and tap **Location**.

![facebook messenger location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg)

Step 3. Now tap **Allow Location** and choose a new location on the world map that appears.

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the "Transfer Files" option.

**Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

On Dr.Fone's home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click **Get Started**. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings > Developer options >USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.

**Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once USB debugging is enabled, press **Next** to launch the map. Now enter your new location's address or GPS coordinates and tap **Move Here**. And there is that!

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

## Part 5. FAQ: What People Also Ask about Facebook Location Services

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

### 3\. How can I hide my location on Facebook?

As said earlier, the reason why Facebook gives the wrong location is because of disabled location settings. It's the reverse! So, use this Settings feature to hide your actual location on Facebook.

### Conclusion

Any queries regarding how to send a fake location on Messenger? Let us know if you have any. Meanwhile, use Messenger's inbuilt location feature to share an artificial place with a friend or contact. But because this method only allows you to share fake locations with a single chat, use Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) instead. It's simple, fast, and effective. Are you ready?

## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)s.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023).

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023), you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)'s camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not
