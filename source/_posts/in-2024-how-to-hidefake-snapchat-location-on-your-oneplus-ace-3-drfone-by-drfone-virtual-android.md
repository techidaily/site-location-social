## How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your OnePlus Ace 3

The GPS functionality is very prominent these days. Especially when various apps or websites are making use of your geological location to deliver more relevant content. Be it, social networking apps or gaming apps, for instance, Snapchat, and Pokemon Go respectively.

![Snapchat interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-1.jpg)

Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location. It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location. Now, this is where you need the Snapchat spoof location app. You not only can hide your actual location from Snapchat. Instead, cast a fake location on Snapchat map, and eventually, you can easily access the badges/filters at your convenience!

Sounds interesting, right? Let’s understand more about the tutorials on how to hide/fake location on Snapchat map.

## Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?

Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.

## Part 2. Why people want to hide/fake location on Snapchat?

When it comes to **fake Snapchat location** there can be several reasons behind that. Here are some scenarios where people do wish to hide/fake location on Snapchat. Let’s explore.

- Sometimes, you may wish to utilize the cute filter that you saw your favorite celebrity putting up when he/she was in Sydney, Australia (or any other location).
- Or, you may wish to simply spoof location Snapchat for fun and be popular among your friends that you know some really cool tricks.
- Perhaps, you wish to stay ahead one step ahead in the dating game. For instance, you’re planning to move to a location a hundred miles away, and wish to have a person to spend quality time with when you reach there.
- Another reason is that is absolutely fun to trick people into believing that you’re spending your leisure time on an expensive tour. For instance, you can check in to a classy restaurant (you’ve never been to in real) in Dubai by mocking the GPS location.
- Even better for the kids who wish to fake GPS location to hide their real location over the location-sharing SnapMap feature from their parents, family, or friends.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your OnePlus Ace 3?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your OnePlus Ace 3.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your OnePlus Ace 3, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your OnePlus Ace 3's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the OnePlus Ace 3 device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your OnePlus Ace 3 is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your OnePlus Ace 3 is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the OnePlus Ace 3 device in advance. Some remote spying apps will allow you to track the location of an iPhone, but you'd require the user's iCloud login and password to enable the tracking of the OnePlus Ace 3 device. Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your OnePlus Ace 3 in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let’s learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

## Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?

We are here to provide the three most-used methods for you to change location on Telegram. Not every solution is suitable for every situation that everyone encounters, but there is always one that is right for you. Some methods may require the assistance of a computer, some can be done only on a mobile phone, and the success rate varies greatly. Now let’s learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.

![ connect the software with Wi-Fi without an USB cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your device’s IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ▪ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ▪ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you’ve selected. That was easy, huh?

## Part 3. FAQs About Creating a Fake GPS on Telegram?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a “red pin” on the address. The actual location doesn’t.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!
