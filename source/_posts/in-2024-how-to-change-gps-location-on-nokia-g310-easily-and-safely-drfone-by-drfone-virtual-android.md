### 3.2 Fake location on WhatsApp using iTools location spoofer

Unfortunately, faking your WhatsApp location on iPhone is not as easy as you think. You can't just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Nokia G310 apps into believing that you are actually at that location.

Users don't even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:

Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Nokia G310 to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.

Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the "Move Here" option on the screen, and your Nokia G310 location will instantly move to that particular location.

Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.

To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your Nokia G310. But you can only do this only 3 times for free. Also, this trick works on any iPhone running on iOS 12 and older.

## Part 4. Use Location Faking App from Google Play (Android Specific)

### 4.1. How to Select a Good App to Fake Location?

The main purpose of using [third-party apps to fake locations](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/top-fake-gps-apps-for-android.html) on WhatsApp is to triangulate your current position. That is why the most important thing in a good GPS faking app is accuracy. If you browse the Google Play Store, you will find unlimited applications that can serve this purpose. But don’t always go for the first choice. Look for features in the app you want such as:

- Location spoofing
- Accurate location up to 20 meters
- Navigate through the map easily
- Fool anyone with your location

You can use [Fake GPS Location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&&hl=en) (or any other app you see proper) to help fake WhatsApp locations on Android. You can also use any other app considered suitable. The operations are just similar.

### 4.2. How to Fake Your Location?

You will be glad to know that it is not that hard to fake live location for WhatsApp if you are using the right application. Here, we will explore using the Fake GPS Location app to share a fake location.

Step 1: Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services and turn the setting on. Also, make sure that WhatsApp has access to your GPS location and install the app on your Nokia G310 from the Play Store.

![Play Store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/fake-gps-location-app.jpg)

![Live Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/share-fake-location.jpg)

If you have shared the fake live location, remember to change it after 15 or 30 minutes.

## Part 5. Can I Find My Friend Has Faked WhatsApp Location?

Some people often wonder if they share fake locations on WhatsApp, then there is a slight chance that their friends do the same with them. But it is a simple trick to figure out if someone has sent a fake location to you.

![identify fake location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/identify-fake-location.jpg)

It is pretty simple, and if someone has sent you a fake location, you will see a red pin dropped on the location with the address text. However, there will be no text address if the location that is shared is original. And that’s how you identify that someone has shared a fake location.
