## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ▪ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ▪ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you’ve selected. That was easy, huh?

## Part 3. FAQs About Creating a Fake GPS on Telegram?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a “red pin” on the address. The actual location doesn’t.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn’t as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can’t just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### What is the Difference between My Profile Location and My Country Setting on Twitter?

Country setting and profile location are both entirely different things. The country setting determines what trends and news will be displayed on your discovery page.

In contrast, profile location is your public location that other users can see when visiting your profile. Therefore, changing your country setting will not impact your original profile location unless you make a change yourself.
