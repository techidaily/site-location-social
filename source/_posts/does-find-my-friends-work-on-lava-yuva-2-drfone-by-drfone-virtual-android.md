## How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Lava Yuva 2

TikTok is a famous entertainment application that shows exciting content worldwide. It is now a popular application with a recorded 3 billion downloads while surpassing the popularity of Facebook and Twitter in 2018. But, sadly, the application keeps on being the victim of restrictions and bans in different countries worldwide.

This limits content broadcast in different regions, making TikTok lovers deprived of entertainment. But, if you know **how to change location on TikTok**, you can surpass all these restrictions easily. The article will help you learn **how to change your TikTok location** by presenting the following aspects:

## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

If you don't want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.

## Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok

We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to **change location on TikTok:**

- **To Add Diversity to the Audience**

The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.

- **Access Better Content**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

- **Use the App without Hurdles**

Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**

If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.

## Part 3: How to Change your Location in TikTok on Different Devices?

### Method 1: Using an App To Spoof Your Location

One of the most effective and safe ways to trick Life360 without triggering notifications is by using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Virtual Location.

#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your Lava Yuva 2 via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the Lava Yuva 2 device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Lava Yuva 2

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Enable **Battery saving** or **Power saving** mode.
