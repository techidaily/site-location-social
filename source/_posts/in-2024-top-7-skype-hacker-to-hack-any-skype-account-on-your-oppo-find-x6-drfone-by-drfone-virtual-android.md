### 2.2. Pin a Location in WhatsApp Location Service

#### 2.2.1 Merits & Demerits

The live location sharing feature in WhatsApp is introduced to give your close ones an idea of your location even when you are constantly moving. The biggest merit of this feature is that it allows the users to track the person's location long after it was shared.

But sometimes, the user shares the live location even when they want to share a fake location on WhatsApp. This really ruins your plan if you are planning to give someone a surprise or doing something special for them.

#### 2.2.2 How to Pin a Location in WhatsApp

The live location feature is entirely optional, and it depends on whether you want to use it. The process to pin a location is pretty simple. If you want to send a fake location on WhatsApp, then you might need some help. But it is easy to pin your live location.

1\. Launch WhatsApp on your phone and open the chat with the person you want to send your location.

2\. Select the icon that looks like a paperclip and choose the Location option.

![choose the Location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/select-location-option.jpg)

3\. There you will see the "Share Live Location" option and then continue. The GPS will automatically pin down your current location, and you will get an option to select the duration for which you want to share the location.

### 3.2 Fake location on WhatsApp using iTools location spoofer

Unfortunately, faking your WhatsApp location on iPhone is not as easy as you think. You can't just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Oppo Find X6 apps into believing that you are actually at that location.

Users don't even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:

Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Oppo Find X6 to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.

Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the "Move Here" option on the screen, and your Oppo Find X6 location will instantly move to that particular location.

![Move Here option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg)

Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.

To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your Oppo Find X6. But you can only do this only 3 times for free. Also, this trick works on any iPhone running on iOS 12 and older.

## Part 4. Use Location Faking App from Google Play (Android Specific)

### 4.1. How to Select a Good App to Fake Location?

The main purpose of using [third-party apps to fake locations](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/top-fake-gps-apps-for-android.html) on WhatsApp is to triangulate your current position.

- Location spoofing
- Accurate location up to 20 meters
- Navigate through the map easily
