### 2.2 Familo

Familo is the best working "finding friend" app. The app is regularly updated, and you can sign up with a phone number. You don't need Facebook or any username to use this app. You have to create a group and invite others. If they sign up, you will get their location details at any time of the day. Of course, they have to approve it first!

![familio app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/familio-app.jpg)

### 2.3 Glympse

What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don't even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.
