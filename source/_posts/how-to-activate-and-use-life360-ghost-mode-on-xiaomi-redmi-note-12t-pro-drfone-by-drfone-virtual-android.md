You can search across different social apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., to see if you can locate your special someone. In addition, you can check profile pictures and refine your searches to increase your chances of finding the correct result.

### Notice

If the name you are searching for is incorrect, or if they spell their name differently than you thought, looking for them on social media will not prove fruitful. Even in today’s digitalized era, some people stay away from online social platforms. In that case, your efforts will all be in vain.

### Conclusion

With the success of social media platforms and online dating services sweeping the world across its feet, nobody can remain anonymous anymore. As a result, you may find people’s profiles by knowing their names, which is undoubtedly good news for introverts with tons of pressure regarding their dating lives.

With the methods mentioned above, you can now **find someone on Tinder** by their name quite easily. These methods can prove effective when you feel like you hit it off with someone but forgot to take their contact information. Try these methods now and find your presumed love interest on Tinder effortlessly.
