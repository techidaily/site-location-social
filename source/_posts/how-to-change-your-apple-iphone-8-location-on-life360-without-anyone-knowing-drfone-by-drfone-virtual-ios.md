### What is the Difference between My Profile Location and My Country Setting on Twitter?

Country setting and profile location are both entirely different things. The country setting determines what trends and news will be displayed on your discovery page.

In contrast, profile location is your public location that other users can see when visiting your profile. Therefore, changing your country setting will not impact your original profile location unless you make a change yourself.
