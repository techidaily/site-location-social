### 4.2. How to Fake Your Location?

You will be glad to know that it is not that hard to fake live location for WhatsApp if you are using the right application. Here, we will explore using the Fake GPS Location app to share a fake location.

Step 1: Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services and turn the setting on. Also, make sure that WhatsApp has access to your GPS location and install the app on your Motorola Edge 40 from the Play Store.

Step 2: Go to the Settings and open "About Phone" info. Find the Build number and tap on 7 times to access the Developer Settings. From developer options, enable the "Allow Mock Locations" option.

Step 3: Now, open the app and search the location that you want to send. Once you have decided which location you want to share, click on the Set Location option.

If you have shared the fake live location, remember to change it after 15 or 30 minutes.

## Part 5. Can I Find My Friend Has Faked WhatsApp Location?

Some people often wonder if they share fake locations on WhatsApp, then there is a slight chance that their friends do the same with them. But it is a simple trick to figure out if someone has sent a fake location to you.

![identify fake location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/identify-fake-location.jpg)

It is pretty simple, and if someone has sent you a fake location, you will see a red pin dropped on the location with the address text. However, there will be no text address if the location that is shared is original. And that’s how you identify that someone has shared a fake location.
