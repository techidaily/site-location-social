## Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?

The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.
