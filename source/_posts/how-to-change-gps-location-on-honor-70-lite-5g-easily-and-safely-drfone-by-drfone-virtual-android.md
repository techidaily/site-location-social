The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users.

The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

**Note:** As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device's location and then share it on WhatsApp.

## Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android & iPhone

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues. Below are some common issues it can help you with:

1. **Lost Messages**

Sometimes you might accidentally or intentionally delete WhatsApp chats or messages. Fortunately, Dr.Fone can help you dig out and recover those messages with a simple click. Just launch the Data Recovery tool, connect your phone to the software, and Dr.Fone will scan for all lost and current messages.

2. **Transfer WhatsApp data**

Thanks to the fast-paced mobile technology, it's inevitable to migrate to a new phone. But you'll have to sacrifice all your WhatsApp data. Luckily, Dr.Fone allows you to backup, restore, and transfer all WhatsApp data.

3. **Backup WhatsApp Business chats**

Having a WhatsApp Business account is vital if you're an online marketer. Here, you can create a business profile and enjoy quick replies, automatic messaging, accurate statistics, etc. So, to avoid losing your invoices and other business chats, use Dr.Fone to back up and transfer your WhatsApp Business chats to a new phone.

### Wrap it Up

See, there's nothing complex about the WhatsApp live location not updating issue. Just update and restart the app or check your location settings if it's enabled. And, of course, use Dr.Fone to share a fake location on WhatsApp and perform other WhatsApp tasks like backing up and transferring data. Thank me later!
