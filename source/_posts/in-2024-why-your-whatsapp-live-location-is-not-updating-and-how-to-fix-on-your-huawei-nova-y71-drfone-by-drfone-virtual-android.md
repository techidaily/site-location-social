## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

In 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live Location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the Location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?

This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode

Another option is to activate Airplane Mode, severing all connections, including location sharing. Again, this method may alert Circle members to your departure.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle on **Airplane Mode**. The method severs all connections, including location sharing.

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Huawei Nova Y71

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.
