- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations.

- **Access Better Content**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**
