## Part 3: FAQs About Twitter Location

1. **Could your location be tracked via Twitter?**

Yes, you can be tracked through Twitter only when set on default settings. As per Twitter privacy, it's required to attain your IP address, location, and other details to offer you valid trends and news that are trending within your region.

2. **How do I enable and disable my location on Twitter?**

Choose “Settings and Privacy,” then “Privacy and Safety.” Then, under “Data sharing and off Twitter activity,” head to “Location Info.” Now, hit on “Add Location Information to your Tweets.” If that box is already ticked, your location is enabled; now, uncheck it to disable it.

3. **What's the reason behind Twitter having the wrong location?**

If you want your Twitter location to be accurate and precise. Firstly, you should enable the location setting from your Twitter application, then go to your mobile settings and enable location services for Twitter. Keep in mind that if one of these settings is not enabled, your location won't be correct.

4. **Why does Twitter hide worldwide trends?**

In 2020, Twitter changed its privacy by removing worldwide trends. Still, few global trends can be seen on the explore page, directly or indirectly connected with your location or your preference of content to offer the best experience to you. But, if you wish to explore more of these worldwide trends, you can always spoof the location.

Its users are always thirsty to debate and share their opinions on various topics, which can, unfortunately, be restricted because of the limited exposure to global trends. But with the help of this detailed article, anyone can easily **change Twitter location** to the desired region.
