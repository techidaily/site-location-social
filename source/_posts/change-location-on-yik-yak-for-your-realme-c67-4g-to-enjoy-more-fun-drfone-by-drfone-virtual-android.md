## Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak

### 1\. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities

As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.

However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you'll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won't be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.

The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

![location apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg)

Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in. You want to know the true south, enable your location, sync with the Compass app, and you'll have the answers.

## Why Your WhatsApp Location is Not Updating and How to Fix On Realme C67 4G

WhatsApp is a free messaging app owned by Meta, initially Facebook. Currently, this platform boasts over two billion active users, even outshining Messenger and WeChat. One of the reasons WhatsApp is popular is letting users share their live location with individuals and group chats. However, sometimes you may experience the annoying **WhatsApp location not updating** issue. Luckily, this article has a solution to this problem. We'll also address **how to share my location on the WhatsApp** issue. Let's learn!

## Part 1: Why is WhatsApp Live Location Not Updating?

First and foremost, let's discuss some of the reasons why your **WhatsApp live location is not updating on Android** or iPhone. Below are some of them:

### 1\. Weak internet connection

You should be conversant with the idea that WhatsApp can't function without the internet. In other words, you can't send or receive messages and calls without strong internet. And the same applies to updating your live location.

### 2\. Disabled location feature

Here's another reason why **WhatsApp live location is not updating on iPhone** or Android. While signing up, WhatsApp will request to access your phone's GPS location. Therefore, disabling this feature by mistake can prevent WhatsApp from updating your location.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.
