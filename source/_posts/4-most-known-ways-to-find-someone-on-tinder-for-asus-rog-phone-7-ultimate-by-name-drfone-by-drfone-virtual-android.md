But, if you know **how to change location on TikTok**, you can surpass all these restrictions easily. The article will help you learn **how to change your TikTok location** by presenting the following aspects:

## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

## Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok

We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to **change location on TikTok:**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**

If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.
