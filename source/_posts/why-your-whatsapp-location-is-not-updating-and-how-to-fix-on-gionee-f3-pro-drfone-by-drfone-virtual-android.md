## Part 1: Why is WhatsApp Live Location Not Updating?

First and foremost, let's discuss some of the reasons why your **WhatsApp live location is not updating on Android** or iPhone. Below are some of them:

### 1\. Weak internet connection

You should be conversant with the idea that WhatsApp can't function without the internet. In other words, you can't send or receive messages and calls without strong internet. And the same applies to updating your live location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Disabled location feature

Here's another reason why **WhatsApp live location is not updating on iPhone** or Android. While signing up, WhatsApp will request to access your phone's GPS location. Therefore, disabling this feature by mistake can prevent WhatsApp from updating your location.

### 3\. Inappropriate time and date

Although uncommon with modern phones, this can be another reason for a wrong live location on WhatsApp. Therefore, connect your phone to the internet to update your date and time. You might also want to restart your phone and see if it works.

## Part 2. How to Fix WhatsApp Live Location Not Updating Problem?

Now that you already know why WhatsApp's live location isn't updating, it's time to check out the solutions. Let's go!

**Step 1. Restart internet connection**

Sometimes, it only takes a simple phone restart to get things back on track. Of course, this will also sort out any bugs in your WhatsApp app. Another thing, you can enable and disable "flight mode" to restart your data connection.

**Step 2. Update the app and phone**

When last did you update your system and apps? You should constantly update your apps and phone system to enjoy better performance and security. It is straightforward!

**Step 3. Enable location service**

You can also check if your location service is enabled on iPhone or Android settings. On iPhone, click Settings > Privacy > Location Service. It's even easier on Android. Swipe down your screen, long-press the GPS button, and enable the Location toggle.

**Step 4. Reset location service on iPhone**

iPhone users can try to reset the Location & Service settings. To do that, open Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy.

**Step 5. Uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp**

If all else fails, then it's probably time to get handy. Simply uninstall your WhatsApp app and then get a newer version on Play Store or App Store. But often, this won't be necessary after updating the app.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

![whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg)

Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device's location and then press the **Share Live Location** button.

![whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg)

Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the **Send** button. That's it!

**Note:** As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device's location and then share it on WhatsApp.

But fret not because you don't even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.

## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof.

In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.
