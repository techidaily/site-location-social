By doing so, you are enhancing your online security, protecting your privacy, and, in some cases, also keeping your personal information a secret.

Then you might wonder, - How do I use apps to navigate the roads or track down that pub in the locality? Well, you can always revert to your original location whenever you want to just that these tricks will help you stay in the safe bubble most of the time.

## Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?

The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

![location apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg)

Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in. You want to know the true south, enable your location, sync with the Compass app, and you'll have the answers.

![compass app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/compass-app-pic5.jpg)

So, to sum that up, the Location Settings will determine which app gets to access your location and which does not. Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it's okay to share the Location. If you accept, that's how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.
