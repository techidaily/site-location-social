There is no option on LinkedIn to hide your location. You can only provide incorrect information by changing, customizing, or setting a fake location but cannot hide it. By default, Linkedin keeps your profile visible to all. You can change it by following the steps given below:

- 1\. Log in to your LinkedIn profile.
- 2\. Go to settings, click on the "Privacy" tab in the menu.
- 3\. Click on the "Edit your public profile" link.

### Final Words

LinkedIn location on your systems as well as mobile devices can be changed either by changing it through app settings or using a professional tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) . Using the software, you can change the location of your device that will automatically update all the GPS and location-based apps, including LinkedIn, accordingly.
