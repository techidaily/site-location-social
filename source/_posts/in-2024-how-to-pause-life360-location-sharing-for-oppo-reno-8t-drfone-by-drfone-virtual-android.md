![location sharing life360 menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-02.jpg)

#### Pausing the Whole App

Regarding this method, pausing the location sharing for all your circles usually involves going through your phone’s **S ettings** and disabling location services for Life360. If you don’t want to do that, you can turn off location sharing for all your circles through the steps provided above.

By understanding and utilizing these features wisely, you can maintain your connection with your loved ones while managing your digital boundaries and battery health effectively. Remember, the aim is to balance connectivity with personal needs.

## Part 2: How To Pause Life360 From Settings

Life360 offers flexibility within its app and through your device’s settings. Understanding how to use these options can provide additional control over location sharing. Explore the various ways **how to pause Life360** outside the app itself.

### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

First, navigate to your Oppo Reno 8T’s **Settings**. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a **Force Stop** button at the bottom of the screen.

By selecting **Force Stop**, you temporarily halt the app’s function without uninstalling it. This operation stops location sharing until you open the app again.

### Pause Life360 From iOS Settings

To **pause the Life360 location** on iOS, you’ll have to open the Settings app on your iOS device. Browse through your apps and select Life360. Alternatively, you can use the search bar and type “Life360”. Once in the app’s menu, change location services to **While Using** the App. Thus, it will not share your location unless you open the app.

### Pause by Using Airplane Mode

### Pause by Uninstalling

Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location. The beauty of this method is that it won’t automatically notify your circles or remove you from them. However, some members might notice that your location updates are unavailable.

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion. Whether conserving battery, seeking privacy, or temporarily disconnecting, these methods provide a way to **pause Life360** **location** without drawing unwanted attention. Remember, communicating with your Circle members about your need for privacy to maintain trust is always a good idea.

## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Oppo Reno 8T in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let’s learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your device’s IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ▪ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ▪ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you’ve selected. That was easy, huh?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a “red pin” on the address. The actual location doesn’t.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

## Does find my friends work on Oppo Reno 8T

Find my friends app is becoming a norm for most people. The Smartphone and app developers are now aware of this. As a result, most Smartphone platforms are adding tools that allow users to share their whereabouts with others. Apple has its native Find my friends for their iPhone. The app works great for a group of iOS users, but you may need to share location with Android devices, which the built-in app can't help you with. When you want to use the "find friends" app, they certainly need to add people from Android and iPhone users. And, you can't dictate what people are choosing as their smartphone platform. While some prefer Android, many of us are dedicated to the iPhone too. Therefore, if you need to keep track of the real-time location of your family members or friends, you need the assistance of a third-party tool. These apps are the most logical way to create a link to find my friends app for Android and iPhone.

### 2.3 Glympse

What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don't even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.
