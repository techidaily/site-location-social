## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

You will now be able to check the new location whenever you click the “Center On.”

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)
