Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn‚Äôt want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Honor Play 40C as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Look for the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù option now and then choose ‚ÄúGet Tinder Plus‚Äù or ‚ÄúTinder Gold‚Äù. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.

**Step 3:** Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.

**Step 4:** Choose ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and hit on ‚ÄúSwiping in‚Äù option. Next, tap on ‚ÄúAdd a new location‚Äù and then you know what to do.
