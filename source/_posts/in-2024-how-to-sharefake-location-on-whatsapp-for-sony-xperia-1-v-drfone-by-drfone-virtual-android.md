**Step 4:** Now, you must set up GIT on Xcode. You will notice a screen showing “Please tell me where you are” and the commands.

You are required to enter the commands in “Terminal”. Open it and type the following:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Please note:** “<you@example.com>” and “your name” should be changed with your info.

**Step 5:** Connect your Sony Xperia 1 V to Mac and wait as Xcode will begin to process some files.

**Step 6:** You can now click on “Debug” menu and choose “Simulate Location”. Choose the desired location now and fake GPS.

## Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.

Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Sony Xperia 1 V device and recheck it.

## Conclusion

Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat. But you must always prefer to choose the right one that could perfectly meet your needs. And it could provide you with the best experience of using Snapchat without any difficulty.
