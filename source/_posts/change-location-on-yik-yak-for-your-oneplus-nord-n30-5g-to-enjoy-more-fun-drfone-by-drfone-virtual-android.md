## Change Location on Yik Yak For your OnePlus Nord N30 5G to Enjoy More Fun

Yik Yak has to be one of the most controversial social media applications. First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.

Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities/states. So keep reading if you've been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today's guide, we will share the best ways to **change the Yik Yak location** and connect with people from different corners of the world.

## Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak

If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here's what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.

Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.

Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.

## Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak

So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone's GPS sensors to detect the current location, you'll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:

### 1\. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities

As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.

However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you'll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won't be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.

### 2\. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location

If you are looking for an effective way to change your location in Yik Yak, we recommend using a professional GPS simulator like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It's a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you'll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

It means you'll be able to publish your own Yik Yak posts from different locations and react to someone else's posts without interruptions. Apart from Yik Yak, you can also use a tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to manipulate GPS signals in other location-based apps like Pokemon Go or Tinder. It's a great way to meet people from other cities on dating apps, as any geo-restrictions won't bind you.

## Part 3: FAQs about Yik Yak

Before concluding this guide, we would like to address a few frequently asked questions about Yik Yak. These are a few common queries across many platforms, including Quora and Reddit.

### _1\. How do you get banned from Yik Yak?_

Since its relaunch, Yik Yak's community guidelines have improved drastically. Now, users have the liberty to downvote any post that they find offensive (in any manner). A post that receives more than 5 downvotes will automatically get removed from the platform, and the account will go under the review stage by the in-house Yik Yak team. The team can then decide whether to block the account or not.

### _2\. Does VPN work with Yik Yak?_

Yes, a VPN can be used with Yik Yak. However, it's not possible to change GPS location with a VPN. For people who don't know, a VPN only changes the IP address of your system and doesn't change the actual GPS location. So if you want to change your GPS location, you'll have to use a dedicated GPS spoofing tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.

### _3\. Can you delete a yak?_

Yes, you can quickly delete any Yak you want on Yik Yak. Yaks are text posts that users publish on the platform. So, as the owner of their posts, they have the power to delete a particular Yak as well. To delete a Yak, all you have to do is tap the “three dots” next to a Yak, click on “More Options,” and then tap the “Delete” button to complete the process.

### Conclusion

Whether you use Yik Yak for fun or have gotten addicted to its anonymity, changing your GPS location on the platform will allow you to expand your social circle and meet strangers from other parts of the world. However, there's no direct way to **change location on Yik Yak**. You'll have to use geo spoofing software such as Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to do the job. The teleport mode feature will make it quite convenient to manipulate your GPS location and access new posts on Yik Yak.

Surfshark has a no-logs policy like the three VPNs on the list, making your online activity safe and anonymous.

### Method 3: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a Proxy Server

Using a Proxy to mask your location on the internet allows you to change your country on YouTube to access blocked content. In this example, we'll use [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php) to view locked YouTube content. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

![use proxfree youtube proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-proxy.jpg)

**Step 2**: On the **Server Location** dialogue box, choose a country in the available options on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Enter the **URL** of the specific video you want to see unblocked and click **PROXFREE** to open YouTube in the proxy's tab.

![unblock youtube using proxfree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/unblock-youtube-proxfree.jpg)

_**Note**: You can also use YouTube's search bar once YouTube's tab is open on your proxy to search YouTube videos as usual._

### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

![unblock youtube using smart dns](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/surfshark-smartdns.jpg)

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.



## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your OnePlus Nord N30 5G

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your OnePlus Nord N30 5G?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your OnePlus Nord N30 5G **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your OnePlus Nord N30 5Gs.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your OnePlus Nord N30 5G, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your OnePlus Nord N30 5G's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your OnePlus Nord N30 5G is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your OnePlus Nord N30 5G is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 2: How to Stop Somebody Spying Using mSpy on the phone?

When you figure out that somebody is spying on your device, the first thing that comes to your mind is how to stop it. If someone has installed mSpy on your device, you can easily control the process. This section will mention the complete process of stopping mSpy on your device. Like the spying app detection process, the spying app removal process is also different in the case of iPhone and Android devices. Below we have mentioned the complete processes of removing mSpy from your OnePlus Nord N30 5G and iPhone device. There are two ways that you can use to remove this app from your devices

### Method 1: Prevent mSpy from Spying via Phone Settings App

To remove mSpy from your OnePlus Nord N30 5G manually, one needs to **activate two-factor authentication and change your iCloud password.**

![iphone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/iphone-settings.jpg)

- **Step 1:** To change the password, you have to go to **Settings.**
- **Step 2:** Click on **Profile.**
- **Step 3:** Select **Password & Security.**

- **Step 5:** Select **Deactivate.**
- **Step 6:** Go back to **Settings.**
- **Step 7:** Select **Apps.**
- **Step 8:** **Uninstall** Update Service.

### Method 2: Play Protect Feature on Google Play Store \[Android only\]

Another trick for removing mSpy from your device is by taking help from the Play Protect feature on Google Play Store. But one limitation of this method is that it does not work for iPhone. It is only useful for Android devices.

![play protect feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/play-protect-feature.jpg)

- **Step 1:** You can also go to the **Google Play store**.
- **Step 2:** Select your **Profile.**

- **Step 5:** Or **scan the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device** for any harmful apps.
- **Step 6:** It will **notify you** if any risky app is found.

### Method 3: Spoof Location to Prevent mSpy from Location Tracking \[Recommended\]

You can use one more method to remove the mSpy app from your device. This method works for both Android as well as iPhone devices. This method spoofs location to prevent the mSpy app from tracking your location. If you feel that someone is tracking your location, you can use third-party app software that helps fake your location. One such app is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is a full mobile device solution for both Android and iPhone devices.
