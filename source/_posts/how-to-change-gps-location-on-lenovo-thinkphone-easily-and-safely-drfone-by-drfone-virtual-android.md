## Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?

The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

![location apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg)

Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in. You want to know the true south, enable your location, sync with the Compass app, and you'll have the answers.

![compass app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/compass-app-pic5.jpg)

So, to sum that up, the Location Settings will determine which app gets to access your location and which does not. Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it's okay to share the Location. If you accept, that's how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Lenovo ThinkPhone.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)
