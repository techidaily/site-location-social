## How to Fake Snapchat Location on Nokia C12 Pro

In this case, you can either turn off the location sharing feature or even fake your Snapchat location. Trust me - with the help of a Snapchat location spoofer, you can easily do it and that too without jailbreaking/rooting your phone. In this post, I will share these tips to fake GPS for Snapchat like a pro!

## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?

Needless to say, if someone has our real-time location access, then they can easily track us. Therefore, if you are concerned about your security or privacy, but can't turn the feature off, then you can use a Snapchat spoof hack. This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.

## Part 3: How to Fake Snapchat Location on iPhone without Jailbreaking it?

Now when you know the different scenarios to spoof location on Snapchat, let's get into some details. Ideally, you can implement a Snapchat fake location hack on both iOS and Android devices. If you own an iOS device, then you can take the assistance of a reliable application like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

## Part 4: How to Fake GPS for Snapchat on Android?

Unlike iPhone, it is pretty easy to fake GPS on Snapchat map for Android devices. This is because there are plenty of fake GPS apps on the Play Store (which is not allowed on the App Store as of now). Though, before you use these apps, you need to make some changes on your Nokia C12 Pro. Here's how you can fake Snapchat location on an Android without rooting.

1. Firstly, you need to unlock your Nokia C12 Pro and visit its Settings > About Phone to tap the "Build Number" feature 7 times straight. After this, you can easily access the Developer Options on your Nokia C12 Pro.

1. Great! Once it is enabled, you can go to its Settings > Developer Options and turn on the feature to mock location on the Nokia C12 Pro device.

1. Now, you can just go to the Play Store and install any reliable fake GPS app on the phone (like Lexa or Hola fake GPS). Later, you can go back to its Settings > Developer Options and let the installed app mock location on your phone.

1. That's it! Now you can simply launch the installed fake GPS app and enter the name/address of the place to spoof your device location. Your location would automatically be changed on all the installed apps (including Snapchat).

### Conclusion

## Part 1: What Is Life360 and How To Pause Life360 From the App

Life360 is not just an app; it’s a digital lifeline connecting people with their loved ones. It’s primarily designed for family and close friends. By offering real-time location sharing, it ensures that members of your “Circle” (a group within the app) know where you are at any given moment. This feature is handy for parents monitoring their children’s whereabouts or friends coordinating meet-ups.

### The Purpose of Life360

At its core, Life360 is about safety and connectivity. The app includes features like location history, driving reports, and even crash detection, making it a versatile tool for modern families. It provides several benefits, like:

- **Safety assurance**. Knowing the whereabouts of your loved ones, especially in emergencies, can be invaluable.
- **Convenience**. Planning gatherings or ensuring a family member has arrived safely at a destination becomes more manageable.
- **Emergency response**. The app can alert users to potential emergencies involving Circle members.

### Reasons of Pausing Life360

However, there are instances where learning **how to pause Life360** becomes necessary:

- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.
- **Privacy**. Sometimes, you might want some privacy about your location. Thus, some people would like to pause their Life360 location sharing.

### Methods To Pause Life360 From the App

Now, the question is, **can you pause your location on Life360?** Pausing Life360 can be done for a specific circle or the entire app. This section will show you some general steps to pause your location for the app. You can do it only for a specific circle or the whole app. Here’s how you can do those.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

![location sharing life360 menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-02.jpg)

#### Pausing the Whole App

Regarding this method, pausing the location sharing for all your circles usually involves going through your phone’s **S ettings** and disabling location services for Life360. If you don’t want to do that, you can turn off location sharing for all your circles through the steps provided above.

By understanding and utilizing these features wisely, you can maintain your connection with your loved ones while managing your digital boundaries and battery health effectively. Remember, the aim is to balance connectivity with personal needs.

## Part 2: How To Pause Life360 From Settings

Life360 offers flexibility within its app and through your device’s settings. Understanding how to use these options can provide additional control over location sharing. Explore the various ways **how to pause Life360** outside the app itself.

### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

First, navigate to your Nokia C12 Pro’s **Settings**. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a **Force Stop** button at the bottom of the screen.

By selecting **Force Stop**, you temporarily halt the app’s function without uninstalling it. This operation stops location sharing until you open the app again.

### Pause Life360 From iOS Settings

To **pause the Life360 location** on iOS, you’ll have to open the Settings app on your iOS device. Browse through your apps and select Life360. Alternatively, you can use the search bar and type “Life360”.

![life360 ios settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-03.jpg)

### Pause by Using Airplane Mode

This can be done from the quick settings panel on both Android and iOS devices. Turning on **Airplane Mode** disables all wireless connections, including cellular data and GPS, effectively pausing Life360. The great thing is that Life360 will only show your last known location to your circles. It will not say that “location services are off,” unlike the first two methods.

![airplane mode ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-04.jpg)

### Pause by Uninstalling

Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location. The beauty of this method is that it won’t automatically notify your circles or remove you from them. However, some members might notice that your location updates are unavailable.

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion. Whether conserving battery, seeking privacy, or temporarily disconnecting, these methods provide a way to **pause Life360** **location** without drawing unwanted attention. Remember, communicating with your Circle members about your need for privacy to maintain trust is always a good idea.
