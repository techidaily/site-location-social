#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

By selecting **Force Stop**, you temporarily halt the app’s function without uninstalling it. This operation stops location sharing until you open the app again.

### Pause Life360 From iOS Settings

To **pause the Life360 location** on iOS, you’ll have to open the Settings app on your iOS device. Browse through your apps and select Life360.

### Pause by Using Airplane Mode

This can be done from the quick settings panel on both Android and iOS devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Pause by Uninstalling

Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location. The beauty of this method is that it won’t automatically notify your circles or remove you from them. However, some members might notice that your location updates are unavailable.

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion. Whether conserving battery, seeking privacy, or temporarily disconnecting, these methods provide a way to **pause Life360** **location** without drawing unwanted attention. Remember, communicating with your Circle members about your need for privacy to maintain trust is always a good idea.

## Part 3: How To Pause Life360 With a Virtual Location Spoofer

- **Place alerts:**Notifies when someone arrives or leaves a designated location (school, home, etc.).
- **Crash detection:**Automatically alerts emergency services and contacts if a car crash is detected.
- **Family messaging:**Allows members to chat within the app, plus read receipts.

## Part 4: Other Ways for Responsible Location Sharing on Life360

Life360 is a valuable tool for staying connected with loved ones and ensuring safety. However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.

Designated Safe Zones

Set up safe zones such as home, school, or work, where location sharing is on. You can change your location on Life360 outside these zones. And turn off sharing for privacy while providing reassurance during crucial times.

Time-Based Sharing

Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.

Location Bubble

Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.

![life360 bubble feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-your-location-on-life-360-12.jpg)

Open Communication

Talk with your family about your concerns about location sharing. Explain your desire for more privacy while emphasizing your commitment to safety. Discuss boundaries and compromise on situations where location sharing feels necessary.

Consider Alternatives
