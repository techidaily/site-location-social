#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your Apple iPhone 13 via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the Apple iPhone 13 device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

- **Step 3:** On the map, enter the number of movements and select **Round** or **Loop** trip. Adjust the speed, then click **Move Here** to start the simulation. **Pause** or clear to revert.

![dr.fone simulate movement with map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

- **Step 4:** To activate **Teleport Mode**, click the **Search** bar. Type a location and hit **Enter**. Click **Move Here** to change the smartphone location on the map. Verify on your smartphone’s maps application. Once done, you spoofed a Life360 circle without anyone knowing.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![dr.fone teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode

Another option is to activate Airplane Mode, severing all connections, including location sharing. Again, this method may alert Circle members to your departure.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png" border="0">Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle on **Airplane Mode**. The method severs all connections, including location sharing.

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Apple iPhone 13

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Enable **Battery saving** or **Power saving** mode.

### Method 7: Getting a Burner Phone

Acquiring a secondary, inexpensive phone for Life360 use may be an alternative if all else fails. This method involves monetary considerations and may not be practical for everyone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Can You Include Non-Family Members in a Circle?

While Life360 is designed for family safety, you can include non-family members in a Circle. The flexibility caters to scenarios where close friends or caregivers need to be part of the safety network.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Is Circle Place Alerts Really That Useful?

The Circle Place Alerts feature proves valuable for users. It allows predefined locations to trigger alerts when members enter or leave those areas. While useful for safety monitoring, its practicality may vary depending on individual preferences and needs.

### What if People in the Circle Feel Micromanaged?

Knowing the feeling of being micromanaged, especially among kids and teens, Life360 introduces the Bubble feature. The Bubble feature allows users to set a custom safety zone. It balances monitoring and granting a sense of autonomy within a designated area.

## Conclusion

Leaving a Life360 Circle can be achieved through the standard method. However, it alerts other members, which can be annoying. While alternative methods exist, they often trigger notifications. If you want to know **how to leave a Life360 circle without anyone knowing**, Dr.Fone is recommended as the optimal tool.

The platform is proficient in location spoofing without alerting the Circle. Whether addressing privacy concerns or aiming for a quick escape, Dr.Fone proves its worth. It’s the preferred choice if you google the question, “**How do I leave a life360 group** online.” Ensure a seamless alone time without notifying other members.
