### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you‚Äôll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you‚Äôll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you‚Äôre actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

- ‚ñ™ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ‚ñ™ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you‚Äôve selected. That was easy, huh?

### Method 3: Fake location on Telegram from free on Android

It‚Äôs absolutely okay to operate on a thin budget these days. So, if you‚Äôre after a free VPN service for Android, use a [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US). It‚Äôs a free program that allows you to spoof your GPS location on Android with a few screen taps. Let‚Äôs have a look!

Step 1. Fire up Play Store and search for ‚Äúfake GPS location.‚Äù You‚Äôll see a yellow emoji holding a phone. Install that app!
