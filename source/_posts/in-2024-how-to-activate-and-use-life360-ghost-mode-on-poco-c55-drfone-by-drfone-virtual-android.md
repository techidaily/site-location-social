![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

## Part 4: Other Ways for Responsible Location Sharing on Life360

Life360 is a valuable tool for staying connected with loved ones and ensuring safety. However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.

Designated Safe Zones

Set up safe zones such as home, school, or work, where location sharing is on. You can change your location on Life360 outside these zones. And turn off sharing for privacy while providing reassurance during crucial times.

Time-Based Sharing

Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.

Location Bubble

Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.

Consider Alternatives

Explore apps with granular privacy controls. Some focus on user privacy and allow for more customized sharing settings. Change your location on Life360 responsibly to balance safety and privacy.
