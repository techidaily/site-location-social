But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you‚Äôre one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let‚Äôs learn!

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you‚Äôll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you‚Äôll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you‚Äôre actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a ‚ÄúPeople Nearby‚Äù feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

## Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?

We are here to provide the three most-used methods for you to change location on Telegram. Not every solution is suitable for every situation that everyone encounters, but there is always one that is right for you. Some methods may require the assistance of a computer, some can be done only on a mobile phone, and the success rate varies greatly. Now let‚Äôs learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your device‚Äôs IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you‚Äôre typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let‚Äôs learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ‚ñ™ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ‚ñ™ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ‚ñ™ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you‚Äôve selected. That was easy, huh?

### Method 3: Fake location on Telegram from free on Android

It‚Äôs absolutely okay to operate on a thin budget these days. So, if you‚Äôre after a free VPN service for Android, use a [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US). It‚Äôs a free program that allows you to spoof your GPS location on Android with a few screen taps. Let‚Äôs have a look!

Step 1. Fire up Play Store and search for ‚Äúfake GPS location.‚Äù You‚Äôll see a yellow emoji holding a phone. Install that app!

Step 2. Next, open **Additional Settings** and choose **Developer options** on your phone. Then, set Fake GPS location as the mock location app.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ fake gps on telegram - select mock mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/fake-gps-on-telegram-4.jpg)

Step 3. Now launch the app and choose your new GPS location. If satisfied, simply tap the green **Play** button.

## Part 3. FAQs About Creating a Fake GPS on Telegram?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a ‚Äúred pin‚Äù on the address. The actual location doesn‚Äôt.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You‚Äôll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn‚Äôt as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can‚Äôt just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### Conclusion

There you go; you can now create a new Telegram location to prank your friends or make new circles using a premium VPN service like ExpressVPN. However, VPN monthly subscriptions can empty your wallet. So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!

## The benefits of setting up a customized location on LinkedIn

Changing and setting a customized location on your LinkedIn profile can be beneficial in several ways, as listed below.

1. **Get the job in the new location**: If you are anytime soon planning to relocate to a new location, searching for a new job after reaching the place can be a time-consuming and hassled task. To prevent this, you can update your LinkedIn location so that prospective employers can search you from the list of job seekers at this new location. Moreover, when you update your location before actually moving, you get more time to search for your choice of job.
2. **Probability of salary raise**: Updating your LinkedIn location will create chances of getting a better salary hike as the prospective employers consider you to be from the same location as theirs and for them, there will be no hassles of work permit issues, and additional cost of relocation.
3. **More job options**: When you update your LinkedIn location, your options for jobs increase, and you become eligible for the jobs which otherwise were not applicable for your location or profile. Thus, access to more job profiles gives you better chances of growing and negotiating.
