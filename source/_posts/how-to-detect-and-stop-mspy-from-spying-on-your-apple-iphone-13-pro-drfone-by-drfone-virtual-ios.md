## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Android **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Android devices.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Apple iPhone 13 Pro's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 3: How to Tell if Your Cell Phone is Being Tracked FAQ

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device in advance.

Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

### Q2: Can Someone Spy on You When your Phone is Off?

Sadly yes. According to What Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said in a 2014 interview that the NSA could listen to and spy on conversations using the microphone on a smartphone, even if you turn off your devices. It makes it by using spyware that prevents your smartphone from actually turning off.

### Q3: Can Someone Read My WhatsApp Chats on My Cell Phone?

Sadly, yes. While it isn't possible on iOS devices, apps can intercept your WhatsApp messages on Android devices due to the operating system's sandboxing security.

### Q4: What Other Forms of Spyware Are There?

Other forms of Spyware include keyboard loggers, Adware, browser hijackers, and modem hijackers.

Now, if we talk about fake location for Snapchat map on iPhone, it’s not as easy as it looks. You need to be an extremely tech-savvy person to **fake Snapchat location without jailbreaking** your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

But fret not, we’re glad to bring you a detailed tutorial with which you can easily perform location spoofing on Snapchat and that too, without jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

Step 1: Install Xcode and Set up a Dummy app

2. For this, fire up the “Terminal”over your Mac and then execute the commands as follows:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Note:** Change the values for “<you@example.com>”and “your name” with your information.

    ![connect iphone to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

7. Once done, opt it in as the build device and while you do it, ensure to keep it unlocked.
8. Lastly, if everything is performed correctly, Xcode will now process some symbol files, please be patient and wait for it to complete.

    ![process some symbol files](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

Step 3: Move Bitmoji

Now, you’re all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the “Debug” menu and then opt for “Simulate Location” from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and you’re done.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Android device. Here’s all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Android device to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.

    ![FakeGPS Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

**Note:** You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”>“About Phone”> hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
