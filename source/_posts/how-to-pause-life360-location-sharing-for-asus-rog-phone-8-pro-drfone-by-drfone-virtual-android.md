- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro. Here’s all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.

**Note:** You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”>“About Phone”> hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
