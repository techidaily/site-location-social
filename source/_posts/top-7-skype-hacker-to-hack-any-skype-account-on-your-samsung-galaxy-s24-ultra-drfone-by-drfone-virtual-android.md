According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters.

#### Method 2: Changing Language on TikTok to Access Content from Other Regions

TikTok only shows the content of languages that are native to your region. Fortunately, you are allowed to change the language on TikTok and access the content of that region. However, this method only shows the content of the selected area.

Therefore, you can't add the language of any such region which has banned the application. Instead, follow the given steps to change your language on TikTok and access the content peacefully:

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok application and select "Profile," written on the lower right-hand corner of the interface.

#### Method 3: Changing your SIM Card to Change Location on Tiktok

TikTok uses the region code of your SIM card to display the content of your region on the feed. Therefore, it will be helpful if you buy a SIM card from another area and use it on Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra to watch that region's content quickly. This process is as simple as choosing a fake location and buying a SIM card from that region.

You can do so by ordering an international SIM card through Amazon and putting your SIM in the mobile phone. Now, delete the cache and app data. Then, open TikTok and enjoy various content. Unfortunately, you will have to buy a phone with a dual SIM. Moreover, some SIM cards might not work in your region unless you buy a mobile plan.
