**Step 2:** Connect your Realme GT 3 to the PC using the lightening cord and click on the “Get Started” option.

![click get started option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3:** Now, you will be able to check your current actual location of yours on the map. After this, you need to activate the “Teleport mode”. This will be the third icon located on the right side of the screen.

Now, enter the location that you desire to teleport and click on the “Go” option.

![hit on move here](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You will now be able to check the new location whenever you click the “Center On.”

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Realme GT 3.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

### 3.2 Fake location on WhatsApp using iTools location spoofer

Unfortunately, faking your WhatsApp location on iPhone is not as easy as you think. You can't just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Realme GT 3 apps into believing that you are actually at that location.

Users don't even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:

Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Realme GT 3 to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.

Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the "Move Here" option on the screen, and your Realme GT 3 location will instantly move to that particular location.

## Part 3: Use Tinder instead

Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.

However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.

**Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.**

**Step 1:** Launch the Tinder in your Realme GT 3 as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.

**Step 3:** Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.

**Step 4:** Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.
