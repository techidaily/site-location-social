## Method 2: Change Facebook Location on Android phone

Unlike the strict iPhones, Android allows you to install a third-party app to change the GPS location of your device and Facebook, to be precise. This means you don't need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you'll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US) app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap. Let's see how to do that:

Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.

Step 2. Next, "allow mock locations" in your Android's developer settings. To do that, open **Settings** >**Additional Settings** >**Developer options**. Then, click "**Select mock location app**" before choosing **Fake GPS**.

![fake gps on facebook settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-02.jpg)

Step 3. Now go to the Fake GPS location app and choose a new location for your device. If satisfied, tap **Ok** to save the added area you'd like your device to appear on.

Step 4. Finally, head to Facebook and change your location settings.

## Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook

Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you're in a particular location when in reality, you're not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It's a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.

So, below is **how to fake location on Facebook** with the Check-In feature:

Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the "**What's on your mind**" field.

Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You'll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.

![fake address and tap gps icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg)

Step 3. Now write whatever is on your mind and add the location to your latest post. It's that easy!

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It's an all-in-one software that provides multiple solutions for your Poco M6 Pro 4G or Android phone. It allows you to teleport your current location to anywhere in the world without jailbreaking your Poco M6 Pro 4G or spending top dollar on a VPN service. This lets you take full advantage of the "Nearby Friends" Facebook feature that needs your actual GPS location.

Below are the key features:

- Transfer phone location to any place in the world.
- Intuitive and detailed zoom-in and zoom-out map.
- Compatible with all iOS and Android versions.
- Move to new locations on the map via different routes and means.
- Compatible with location-based apps like Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 and How To Pause Life360 From the App

Life360 is not just an app; it’s a digital lifeline connecting people with their loved ones. It’s primarily designed for family and close friends. By offering real-time location sharing, it ensures that members of your “Circle” (a group within the app) know where you are at any given moment. This feature is handy for parents monitoring their children’s whereabouts or friends coordinating meet-ups.

### The Purpose of Life360

At its core, Life360 is about safety and connectivity. The app includes features like location history, driving reports, and even crash detection, making it a versatile tool for modern families. It provides several benefits, like:

- **Safety assurance**. Knowing the whereabouts of your loved ones, especially in emergencies, can be invaluable.

However, there are instances where learning **how to pause Life360** becomes necessary:

- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.
- **Privacy**. Sometimes, you might want some privacy about your location. Thus, some people would like to pause their Life360 location sharing.

### Methods To Pause Life360 From the App

Now, the question is, **can you pause your location on Life360?** Pausing Life360 can be done for a specific circle or the entire app. This section will show you some general steps to pause your location for the app. You can do it only for a specific circle or the whole app. Here’s how you can do those.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

### Pause by Using Airplane Mode

This can be done from the quick settings panel on both Android and iOS devices. Turning on **Airplane Mode** disables all wireless connections, including cellular data and GPS, effectively pausing Life360. The great thing is that Life360 will only show your last known location to your circles. It will not say that “location services are off,” unlike the first two methods.

### Pause by Uninstalling

Removing the app from your device will stop it from sharing your location. The beauty of this method is that it won’t automatically notify your circles or remove you from them. However, some members might notice that your location updates are unavailable.

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion. Whether conserving battery, seeking privacy, or temporarily disconnecting, these methods provide a way to **pause Life360** **location** without drawing unwanted attention. Remember, communicating with your Circle members about your need for privacy to maintain trust is always a good idea.

## Part 3: How To Pause Life360 With a Virtual Location Spoofer

Sometimes, pausing your location sharing on Life360 may raise questions or concerns among your circle members, particularly if they are close family or friends. If you’re planning a surprise or need private time without arousing suspicion, a virtual location spoofer can be handy. This method will teach you **how to pause your location on Life360 without them knowing.**



[Wondershare’s Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) toolkit is more than just a data recovery solution.

### Method 5: Use a Burner Phone

While it may seem cumbersome, using a burner phone is a straightforward method to disable location sharing on Life360. Install Life360 on the burner phone using the same account. Connect it to the relevant WiFi, and then remove Life360 from your primary device.

### Method 6: Use a VPN Service

Using a VPN service alters your IP address, which can help spoof Life360 to show an inaccurate location. The approach is beneficial when you aim to conceal your location without entirely turning off location sharing. Remember, though, that it’s not foolproof and may not provide consistent results.

The ease of enabling Ghost Mode on/off using Dr.Fone makes it a convenient option. Striking the right balance between connectivity and privacy in Life360 requires thoughtful consideration. Explore the dynamics of **Ghost Mode in Life360** to decide if it aligns with your preferences and needs.
