## Part 4: FAQs About Facebook Dating

### 1.Can my friends see if I use Facebook Dating?

It is one of the many advantages of using Facebook dating. It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don't expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don't expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.

### 2\. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?

If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person's photo or hitting the love icon. Let's elaborate on how you do either of the two.

**Sending a Like**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the love icon to send the like.

**Starting a conversation**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.

It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.

### 3\. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?

One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users' profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.

That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that's a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn't mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.

### 4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?

Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn't support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.

### 5\. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?

Seeing someone's Facebook Dating profile can be a daunting task. Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can't expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.

### Conclusion

It is an excellent way of meeting new friends who live outside your residence area. In addition to that, you can also use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake your location when using other social media platforms, games, and dating sites.

## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Samsung Galaxy A23 5Gs.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not
