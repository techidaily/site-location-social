## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?

Needless to say, if someone has our real-time location access, then they can easily track us. Therefore, if you are concerned about your security or privacy, but can't turn the feature off, then you can use a Snapchat spoof hack. This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.

Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.

## Part 2: How to enable/disable and share Location Filters on Snapchat posts?

First and foremost, creating a Snapchat location filter on Android or iPhone is super-duper easy. However, to share your location on Snapchat posts, you must activate this setting within the app. Also, enable the location service on your smartphone. On Android, open Settings > Location, whereas on iPhone, click Settings > Privacy > Location Services.

Here's how to enable or disable the Location Filter settings:

**Step 1.** Fire up Snapchat on your Vivo X90S or Android phone and tap your **Profile** icon.

**Step 2.** Then, press the **Settings** button and find and press the **Additional Services** option.

**Step 3.** Lastly, tap Manage and then enable the **Filters** to toggle, and that's it!

Now that this setting is enabled on Snapchat, you can add your location filter effect. Follow me:

**Step 1.** Open Snapchat and take a video or a photo.

**Step 2.** Next, swipe the screen to the left until you find the location effect. Remember, Snapchat uses your actual GPS location.

**Step 3.** You can also tag a location on Snapchat by clicking the **Sticker** icon on the right rail. Then, tap the **Location** button and then choose your GPS location. Interestingly, you can spoof a location with this feature.

## Part 3: How to Change or Add a Fake Location on Snapchat Filters?

The thing is that Snapchat uses your phone's GPS or Wi-Fi connection to determine your actual location and add it to the location filter. Therefore, it's virtually impossible to spoof Snapchat's location unless you're using a VPN service.

Fortunately, you don't need those overpriced VPNs if you can get [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). This smartphone utility program allows you to change your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world with a simple mouse click on your PC. In addition, you can simulate Snapchat location movements to make it look more realistic. And apart from Snapchat, you can spoof location on WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, etc.

So, without dilly-dallying much, here's how to fake a **Snapchat location tag** with Dr.Fone:



### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-system-repair.html)

1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android

- Teleport GPS location to anywhere with one click.

### Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!

### Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?

The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don't have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.

### Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?

Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won't update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.

### Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?

While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone's GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile > Settings > See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you'll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You'll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can't find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.

### Wrap it Up

Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post.

This tool also works with other social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Enjoy!
