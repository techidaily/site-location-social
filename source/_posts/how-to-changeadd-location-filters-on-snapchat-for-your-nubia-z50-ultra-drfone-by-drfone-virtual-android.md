## Part 3: How to Change or Add a Fake Location on Snapchat Filters?

The thing is that Snapchat uses your phone's GPS or Wi-Fi connection to determine your actual location and add it to the location filter. Therefore, it's virtually impossible to spoof Snapchat's location unless you're using a VPN service.

Fortunately, you don't need those overpriced VPNs if you can get [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). This smartphone utility program allows you to change your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world with a simple mouse click on your PC.

And apart from Snapchat, you can spoof location on WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, etc.

## Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat

### Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!

### Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?

The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don't have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?

Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won't update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?

While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone's GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.

### Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile > Settings > See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you'll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You'll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can't find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.

### Wrap it Up

Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can't spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world. This tool also works with other social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Enjoy!

So, is it possible to **Viber's fake location**? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one.

But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your device’s IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ▪ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ▪ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you’ve selected. That was easy, huh?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn’t as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can’t just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites.
