### 2\. Disabled location feature

Here's another reason why **WhatsApp live location is not updating on iPhone** or Android. While signing up, WhatsApp will request to access your phone's GPS location. Therefore, disabling this feature by mistake can prevent WhatsApp from updating your location.

### 3\. Inappropriate time and date

Although uncommon with modern phones, this can be another reason for a wrong live location on WhatsApp. Therefore, connect your phone to the internet to update your date and time. You might also want to restart your phone and see if it works.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

## How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Nubia Z50S Pro

The GPS functionality is very prominent these days. Especially when various apps or websites are making use of your geological location to deliver more relevant content. Be it, social networking apps or gaming apps, for instance, Snapchat, and Pokemon Go respectively.

![Snapchat interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-1.jpg)

Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location. It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location. Now, this is where you need the Snapchat spoof location app. You not only can hide your actual location from Snapchat. Instead, cast a fake location on Snapchat map, and eventually, you can easily access the badges/filters at your convenience!

Sounds interesting, right? Let’s understand more about the tutorials on how to hide/fake location on Snapchat map.

## Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?

Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.

![your Bitmoji on SnapMap](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-2.jpg)

## Part 2. Why people want to hide/fake location on Snapchat?

When it comes to **fake Snapchat location** there can be several reasons behind that. Here are some scenarios where people do wish to hide/fake location on Snapchat. Let’s explore.

- Sometimes, you may wish to utilize the cute filter that you saw your favorite celebrity putting up when he/she was in Sydney, Australia (or any other location).
- Or, you may wish to simply spoof location Snapchat for fun and be popular among your friends that you know some really cool tricks.
- Perhaps, you wish to stay ahead one step ahead in the dating game. For instance, you’re planning to move to a location a hundred miles away, and wish to have a person to spend quality time with when you reach there.
- Another reason is that is absolutely fun to trick people into believing that you’re spending your leisure time on an expensive tour. For instance, you can check in to a classy restaurant (you’ve never been to in real) in Dubai by mocking the GPS location.
- Even better for the kids who wish to fake GPS location to hide their real location over the location-sharing SnapMap feature from their parents, family, or friends.

## Part 3. How to hide location on Snapchat

When it comes to disabling or hiding the location on Snapchat, the tutorial is extremely easy. Snapchat itself offers you a setting called Ghost mode. You just need to enable it. Here’s how to get it done.

1. First, get into the Snapchat app and then visit either the Discover screen or the Camera or Friends. Next, tap on the magnifying glass and hit on Map.
2. As soon as the SnapMap screen loads up, you need to access the settings by hitting the Gear icon on the top right corner.

    ![start Ghost Mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-3.jpg)

3. Then, make use of the settings to set up your privacy and hit on the “Ghost Mode” toggle switch to turn it on. A pop-up window will appear with 3 different settings:

- 3 hours : Ghost mode is turned on for 3 straight hours.
- 24 hours : Ghost mode is turned on for 24 straight hours.
- Until Turned Off : Ghost mode is turned on until you manually turn it off.

5. Selecting either of the aforementioned settings will hide your location from SnapMap. Implies, other than you no one will be able to locate you over SnapMap.
