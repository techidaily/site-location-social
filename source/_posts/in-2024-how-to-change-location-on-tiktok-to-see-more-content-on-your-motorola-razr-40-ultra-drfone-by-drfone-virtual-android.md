## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

If you don't want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.

## Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok

We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to **change location on TikTok:**

- **To Add Diversity to the Audience**

The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.

- **Access Better Content**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

- **Use the App without Hurdles**

Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**

If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.

Therefore, you can't add the language of any such region which has banned the application. Instead, follow the given steps to change your language on TikTok and access the content peacefully:

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok application and select "Profile," written on the lower right-hand corner of the interface.

![tap on profile option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/change-location-on-tiktok-1.jpg)

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn’t as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can’t just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### Conclusion

There you go; you can now create a new Telegram location to prank your friends or make new circles using a premium VPN service like ExpressVPN. However, VPN monthly subscriptions can empty your wallet. So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!

## Part 4: Other Ways for Responsible Location Sharing on Life360

Life360 is a valuable tool for staying connected with loved ones and ensuring safety. However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.

Designated Safe Zones

Time-Based Sharing

Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.

Location Bubble

Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.
