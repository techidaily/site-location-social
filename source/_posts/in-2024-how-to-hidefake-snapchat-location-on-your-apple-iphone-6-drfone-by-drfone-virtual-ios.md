## How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Apple iPhone 6

Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location. It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location. Now, this is where you need the Snapchat spoof location app. You not only can hide your actual location from Snapchat. Instead, cast a fake location on Snapchat map, and eventually, you can easily access the badges/filters at your convenience!

Sounds interesting, right? Let’s understand more about the tutorials on how to hide/fake location on Snapchat map.

## Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?

Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.

## Part 4: Other Ways for Responsible Location Sharing on Life360

Life360 is a valuable tool for staying connected with loved ones and ensuring safety. However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.

Designated Safe Zones

Set up safe zones such as home, school, or work, where location sharing is on. You can change your location on Life360 outside these zones. And turn off sharing for privacy while providing reassurance during crucial times.

Time-Based Sharing

Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.

Location Bubble

Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.

![life360 bubble feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-your-location-on-life-360-12.jpg)

Open Communication

Talk with your family about your concerns about location sharing. Explain your desire for more privacy while emphasizing your commitment to safety. Discuss boundaries and compromise on situations where location sharing feels necessary.

Consider Alternatives

Explore apps with granular privacy controls. Some focus on user privacy and allow for more customized sharing settings. Change your location on Life360 responsibly to balance safety and privacy.

## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Apple iPhone 6 in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Let’s learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

![dr.fone home page screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Install and run Dr.Fone on your PC and then connect your smartphone to your computer using a USB wire. While doing so, make sure you enable the “Transfer Files” option on your phone. Then, on the home window of Dr.Fone, tap **Virtual Location** and then tap **Get Started** on the new window.

#### Step 2. Link your smartphone to Dr.Fone

![connect the software with Wi-Fi without an USB cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

Next, open your smartphone’s Settings app and enable USB debugging to connect it to Dr.Fone. Fortunately, this program comes with a simple guide for all iOS and Android versions.

**Pro tip:** If you’re an Android user, click Settings> Additional Settings> Developer options> USB debugging. Also, remember to choose Dr.Fone under the “Select mock location app” section.

#### Step 3. Choose your desired location and move

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your device’s IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- ▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- ▪ Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- ▪ Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country you’ve selected. That was easy, huh?

### Method 3: Fake location on Telegram from free on Android

It’s absolutely okay to operate on a thin budget these days. So, if you’re after a free VPN service for Android, use a [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US). It’s a free program that allows you to spoof your GPS location on Android with a few screen taps. Let’s have a look!

Step 1. Fire up Play Store and search for “fake GPS location.” You’ll see a yellow emoji holding a phone. Install that app!

Step 2. Next, open **Additional Settings** and choose **Developer options** on your phone. Then, set Fake GPS location as the mock location app.

![fake gps on telegram - select mock mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/fake-gps-on-telegram-4.jpg)

Step 3. Now launch the app and choose your new GPS location. If satisfied, simply tap the green **Play** button.

## Part 3. FAQs About Creating a Fake GPS on Telegram?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

Unfortunately, you can easily detect if someone is faking their Telegram GPS location. A fake location usually has a “red pin” on the address. The actual location doesn’t.

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

You’ll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isn’t as straightforward as Android. In other words, you can’t just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### Conclusion

There you go; you can now create a new Telegram location to prank your friends or make new circles using a premium VPN service like ExpressVPN. However, VPN monthly subscriptions can empty your wallet. So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!
