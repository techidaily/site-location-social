<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

**Step 2:** Connect your Lava Blaze 2 5G to the PC using the lightening cord and click on the “Get Started” option.

![click get started option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3:** Now, you will be able to check your current actual location of yours on the map. After this, you need to activate the “Teleport mode”. This will be the third icon located on the right side of the screen.

Now, enter the location that you desire to teleport and click on the “Go” option.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4:** The program will analyze the place that you have entered, and it will show you the distance for that place in a pop-up window. Hit on “Move Here”.

![hit on move here](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You will now be able to check the new location whenever you click the “Center On.”

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Lava Blaze 2 5G.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

**Step 7:** Open the app now and set the desired location. Tap on the “Play” button, and you’re good to go.

## Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.

Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Lava Blaze 2 5G device and recheck it.

### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode
