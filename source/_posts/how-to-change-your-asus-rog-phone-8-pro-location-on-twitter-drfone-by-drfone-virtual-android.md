**Step 4:** Then, right at the end of this bottom line, you will find an 'i' icon. Click on that and then go with the wishlist. There you can choose the apps that can access your virtually changed location. Then Click on 'Done' when you are finished.

The problem with this method is that certain apps downright refuse to function when they detect that you have jailbroken your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device. So, keep that in mind when you are making your choice.
