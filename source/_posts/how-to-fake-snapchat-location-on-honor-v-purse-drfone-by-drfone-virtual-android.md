In this post, I will share these tips to fake GPS for Snapchat like a pro!

## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).
