## How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On Motorola Moto G04

Snapchat users are very fond of using custom filters when sharing content on the app. It is a great way to ensure that your images and videos are only viewed by the people that you target. However, a new feature called Geo-filters has brought a lot of mixed feelings amongst Snachatters.

The filter is location-based, which makes any content that you share to be seen by people who are within your geographic fence.

Imagine that you are standing at the Niagara Falls and want to share with people who are in Europe; you will not be able to do this and this is why the filters are problematic to people in the Snapchat community.

Thankfully, there are ways in which you can spoof our device, allowing you to access Geofilters anywhere in the world. Today, you learn several ways in which you can achieve this objective with ease.


## Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us

Snapchat comes with a lot of filters, both sponsored and crowdsourced, which you can use to interact with different people. When Geofilters was introduced, it meant that you could only access filters that were designed for specific locations.

Sponsored filters generally tend to target people in certain areas, and this can limit how you disseminate your content on Snapchat.

The main benefit that you get from faking Snapchat is getting access to these filters without even moving an inch.

When you spoof your device, Snapchat thinks that you are actually in the area that you have spoofed to. This virtual location will then allow you to access the filters that are available in that area.

## Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak

One of the best ways to fake Snapchat without jailbreak is to use XCode. This is an app on your Motorola Moto G04 that allows you to tweak certain aspects of the apps that you have on your device, including Snapchat.

Get XCode on your device and then launch it. Start by using the locations that are found to setup XCode. You can download XCode from Apple App Store. You will need your Apple ID and password to use XCode.

![Choose a location from XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-1.jpg)

Here are the steps that you have to follow:

**Step 1: Start by creating a basic single-view application**

Launch XCode and then create a new project

![Create a new project in XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-2.jpg)

Then choose the option marked “Single View iOS application.

![Choose the ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-3.jpg)

Now customize the project options and give it any name that you desire.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Name the project as you wish](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-4.jpg)

Now proceed and customize the Organization Name and the Identifier. The identifier works like a reverse domain name so you can use anything you desire.

Proceed and select swift as your preferred language and then click on “iPhone” as your device so the app will be small.

Any other options below this should be left in their default states.

Now go ahead and save the project to a location on your computer. Since the version control does not apply in this case, make sure that you uncheck the option before you save the app.

![Save your app](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-5.jpg)

**Step 2: transfer and run the created app on your iOS device**

People who do not have the latest version of XCode will run into the error shown below.

![Error for older XCode versions](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-6.jpg)

**IMPORTANT:** do NOT click on “Fix Issue” until you do the following tasks:

- Access the preferences on your XCode
- Choose the accounts tab
- Click on the add (+) icon at the bottom left side of your screen
- Now choose “Add Apple ID”.
- Type in your Apple ID and password

You should now have an accounts screen similar to the one shown in the image below.

![Error solved screen](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

Now close the window and click on the “team” dropdown menu. You may now select the Apple ID that you just created.

Now you can go ahead and click on the “Fix Issue” button.

Now the error will be resolved and you should have a screen that is similar to the image below.

![Correct options in XCode](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

You may now run the app that you created before on your iOS device.

Use an original USB cable to connect the iOS device to your computer.

Towards the top right-hand corner of your screen, click on the button that is displaying your project name and then click on the iOS device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Run the app on the iPhone](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

Now your iOS device will be showing at the top. Select it and proceed.

![select your iOS device in the app ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

Hit the “Play” icon that is found at the top left side of your screen.

Wait for the process to be complete. You might as well get a cup of coffee as this can take quite a while.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Wait for the process to be complete](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

When the process is complete, XCode will install the app on your iOS device. You will get the following error if your device has not been unlocked; unlocking the iOS device will put off the error message.

![XCode error for locked iPhone](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

Now you should be viewing a blank screen on your iOS device. Do not worry; your device has not been ruined. This is the app that you have just created and installed. Pressing the “Home” button will dismiss the blank screen.

**Step 3: It’s time to spoof your location**

Go to Google Maps or iOS maps which will now show your current location.

Go to XCode and then choose "Simulate Location" from the "Debug" menu and then select a different location to test.

![simulate your new location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg)

If you have done all that you need to do, then the location of your iOS device should instantly jump to the location that you have chosen.

![New location on iOS maps and Google Maps](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg)

Now you can proceed and see if you have access to Geo-filters in the new location.

**Step 4: Spy Geo-Filters on Snapchat**

Now you can launch Snapchat and then access the filters in the area that you have teleported to. Remember that you can move from one location to the next on XCode without having to close Snapchat. Just cancel the current snap after changing the location and create a new snap to see the filters in the new location. If this fails to respond, then go back to Google maps or iOS map app and then ensure that you are in the desired location. Once you have done so, close Snapchat and restart it again, and you will be in the new location once more.

## Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak

You can also fake your Snapchat GPS location using a premium app such as iTools. This is a popular application, used to spoof many other apps that require geo-location data to work. Another point to note is that the latest iPhone models cannot be jailbroken. The iOS version today is very secure and you cannot tweak it like before.

Thankfully, you can use a premium, not free, iTools to change your virtual location without jailbreaking the Motorola Moto G04 device. You can get iTools on a trial basis, but after the period expires, you will have to pay $30.95 to continue using it.

**Step 1:** Download and install iTools on your computer and then launch it. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the original USB cable that came with the Motorola Moto G04 device.

**Step 2:** Go to the iTools panel and click on “toolbox”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![select Virtual Location in Toolbox](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Type in the location that you want to teleport to and then click on ‘Move Here”.

![Select your desired location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-3.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now open your Snapchat and you will be able to access the filters found in the location that you typed in.

Once you are finished with this spoofed location, you can simply select “Stop Simulation” in iTools. This is a premium tool, but very simple to use. It is the best tool to use, especially if you are having a device with the latest iOS version.

![stop simulation after you have finished with the new location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-4.jpg)

## Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location

From the steps used in both methods, it is very clear that iTools is the best app to use to fake your Snapchat GPS location for several reasons. Here are some of them:

- **Ease of use -** Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.
- **Price –** Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.
- **Security –** XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.
- **Versatility –** XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.

## In conclusion

When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools. There are various benefits that you gain from teleporting using these tools, with Geo-Filters access being the biggest benefit. If you want to use Snapchat all over the world without moving out of your home, then these are the ways that you can go about it.

### 1.Can my friends see if I use Facebook Dating?

It is one of the many advantages of using Facebook dating. It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don't expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don't expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.

### 2\. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?

If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person's photo or hitting the love icon. Let's elaborate on how you do either of the two.

**Sending a Like**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the love icon to send the like.

**Starting a conversation**

- Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.
- From the choices displayed, select the "Dating" Option.
- Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.

It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?

One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users' profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.

That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that's a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn't mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?

Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn't support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.

### 5\. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?

Seeing someone's Facebook Dating profile can be a daunting task. Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can't expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.

### Conclusion

It is an excellent way of meeting new friends who live outside your residence area. In addition to that, you can also use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake your location when using other social media platforms, games, and dating sites. It ensures that no one can easily track you, which is ideal for your safety and privacy. If you **can't change your Facebook dating location**, you can always turn Facebook location services off. Last but not least, it puts at your disposal the answers to frequently asked questions on Facebook Dating. So, don't let your location determine the features and services you get to use, especially the restricted ones.

## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Motorola Moto G04

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Motorola Moto G04?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Motorola Moto G04 **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Motorola Moto G04s.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Motorola Moto G04.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Motorola Moto G04, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Motorola Moto G04's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Motorola Moto G04 device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Motorola Moto G04 is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Motorola Moto G04 is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

### Q1: Is it possible if someone remotely install surveillance software on My Motorola Moto G04?

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Motorola Moto G04 device in advance. Some remote spying apps will allow you to track the location of an iPhone, but you'd require the user's iCloud login and password to enable the tracking of the Motorola Moto G04 device. Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.
