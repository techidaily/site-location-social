### Method 3: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a Proxy Server

Using a Proxy to mask your location on the internet allows you to change your country on YouTube to access blocked content. In this example, we'll use [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php) to view locked YouTube content. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

![use proxfree youtube proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-proxy.jpg)

**Step 2**: On the **Server Location** dialogue box, choose a country in the available options on the dialogue box.

### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the Lava Yuva 2 device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

![unblock youtube using smart dns](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/surfshark-smartdns.jpg)

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.

1. **Get the job in the new location**: If you are anytime soon planning to relocate to a new location, searching for a new job after reaching the place can be a time-consuming and hassled task. To prevent this, you can update your LinkedIn location so that prospective employers can search you from the list of job seekers at this new location. Moreover, when you update your location before actually moving, you get more time to search for your choice of job.
2. **Probability of salary raise**: Updating your LinkedIn location will create chances of getting a better salary hike as the prospective employers consider you to be from the same location as theirs and for them, there will be no hassles of work permit issues, and additional cost of relocation.
3. **More job options**: When you update your LinkedIn location, your options for jobs increase, and you become eligible for the jobs which otherwise were not applicable for your location or profile. Thus, access to more job profiles gives you better chances of growing and negotiating.

## Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Lava Yuva 2 in 3 Ways

Telegram is an ad-free messaging application for Android and iOS. This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the âPeople Nearbyâ feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a **fake GPS on Telegram**? If youâre one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a **Telegram fake GPS** quickly and easily. Letâs learn!

## Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?

There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:

### 1\. Protect your privacy

While signing up on Telegram, youâll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, youâll need to spoof GPS.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Prank your friends

Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when youâre actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.

### 3\. Make new friends

As said before, Telegram has a âPeople Nearbyâ feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the "People Nearby" feature will match your new GPS location.

## Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?

We are here to provide the three most-used methods for you to change location on Telegram. Not every solution is suitable for every situation that everyone encounters, but there is always one that is right for you. Some methods may require the assistance of a computer, some can be done only on a mobile phone, and the success rate varies greatly. Now letâs learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.

### Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android/ iOS with the best Location Changer

### Method 2: Fake a live telegram location via VPN (Android & iOS)

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is arguably the most reliable way to create a **Telegram fake GPS**. With a professional VPN service, you can change your deviceâs IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where youâre typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

For example, letâs learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android/iPhone:

- âª Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.
- âª Step 2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ExpressVPN and choose a VPN server location.
- âª Step 3. Lastly, tap the **Power** button to connect to the VPN server in the country youâve selected. That was easy, huh?

### Q1: Can my friends know when I fake a Telegram location?

### Q2: Is Telegram better than WhatsApp?

Youâll be surprised to learn that Telegram offers better security features than WhatsApp. This platform encrypts messages between you and the server, meaning that no one else can access your chats. For WhatsApp, the jury is still out.

### Q3: Can I spoof location on iPhone?

Sadly, creating a Telegram fake location on iPhone isnât as straightforward as Android. In other words, you canât just install a GPS app from Play Store and enjoy the new sites. So, use a program like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) or purchase a VPN service.

### Conclusion

There you go; you can now create a new Telegram location to prank your friends or make new circles using a premium VPN service like ExpressVPN. However, VPN monthly subscriptions can empty your wallet. So, use a pocket-friendly and reliable option like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily fake GPS location on Android and iPhone. Give it a try!
