## 6\. Highster Mobile

Highster Mobile has been one of the oldest apps that is available on the market. It not only hacks Skype but also helps to track other social media as well as carries out other monitoring activities which can be useful to monitor the target’s behavior. You will need to root your target device in order to spy on their Skype activities. Since this application runs in the background as well as hides under a pseudo name, it is difficult for the targeted user to find and delete it manually.
