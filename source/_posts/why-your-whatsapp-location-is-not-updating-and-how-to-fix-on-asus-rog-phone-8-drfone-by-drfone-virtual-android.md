## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

While it may seem cumbersome, using a burner phone is a straightforward method to disable location sharing on Life360. Install Life360 on the burner phone using the same account. Connect it to the relevant WiFi, and then remove Life360 from your primary device.

### Method 6: Use a VPN Service

Using a VPN service alters your IP address, which can help spoof Life360 to show an inaccurate location. The approach is beneficial when you aim to conceal your location without entirely turning off location sharing. Remember, though, that it’s not foolproof and may not provide consistent results.

## Conclusion

**Life360 Ghost Mode**, though not an official feature, provides a discreet way to enhance privacy within the app. While it’s a valuable tool for moments when you need personal space, be aware of its downsides. If Ghost Mode seems too risky, explore alternative methods.

The ease of enabling Ghost Mode on/off using Dr.Fone makes it a convenient option. Striking the right balance between connectivity and privacy in Life360 requires thoughtful consideration. Explore the dynamics of **Ghost Mode in Life360** to decide if it aligns with your preferences and needs.
