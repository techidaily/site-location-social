6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
