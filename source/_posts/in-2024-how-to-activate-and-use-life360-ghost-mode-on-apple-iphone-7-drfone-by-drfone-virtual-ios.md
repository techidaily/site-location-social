## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

If you don't want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.

## Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok

We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to **change location on TikTok:**

- **To Add Diversity to the Audience**

The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.

- **Access Better Content**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

- **Use the App without Hurdles**

Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**

If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.

#### Method 2: Changing Language on TikTok to Access Content from Other Regions

TikTok only shows the content of languages that are native to your region. Fortunately, you are allowed to change the language on TikTok and access the content of that region. However, this method only shows the content of the selected area.

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok application and select "Profile," written on the lower right-hand corner of the interface.

![tap on profile option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/change-location-on-tiktok-1.jpg)

#### Method 3: Changing your SIM Card to Change Location on Tiktok

TikTok uses the region code of your SIM card to display the content of your region on the feed. Therefore, it will be helpful if you buy a SIM card from another area and use it on Your Apple iPhone 7 to watch that region's content quickly. This process is as simple as choosing a fake location and buying a SIM card from that region.

You can do so by ordering an international SIM card through Amazon and putting your SIM in the mobile phone. Now, delete the cache and app data. Then, open TikTok and enjoy various content. Unfortunately, you will have to buy a phone with a dual SIM. Moreover, some SIM cards might not work in your region unless you buy a mobile plan.
