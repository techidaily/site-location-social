## The benefits of setting up a customized location on LinkedIn

Changing and setting a customized location on your LinkedIn profile can be beneficial in several ways, as listed below.

1. **Get the job in the new location**: If you are anytime soon planning to relocate to a new location, searching for a new job after reaching the place can be a time-consuming and hassled task. To prevent this, you can update your LinkedIn location so that prospective employers can search you from the list of job seekers at this new location. Moreover, when you update your location before actually moving, you get more time to search for your choice of job.
2. **Probability of salary raise**: Updating your LinkedIn location will create chances of getting a better salary hike as the prospective employers consider you to be from the same location as theirs and for them, there will be no hassles of work permit issues, and additional cost of relocation.
3. **More job options**: When you update your LinkedIn location, your options for jobs increase, and you become eligible for the jobs which otherwise were not applicable for your location or profile. Thus, access to more job profiles gives you better chances of growing and negotiating.

## FAQ: All you want to know about changing location on LinkedIn

### 1\. Should I change my location on LinkedIn, although I haven’t relocated yet?

If you are planning to relocate to a new place soon, updating your LinkedIn location is fine. Location update will help you target the job market and with job-seeking to get the desired job. It is suggested that suppose if you are moving to ABC location soon, you can update your LinkedIn location to ABC but at the same time mention your present current location, somewhere in the profile. Mentioning your current location will not create any feeling of being cheated or misled by the people who visit your profile.

### 2\. How do I hide my location on LinkedIn?

There is no option on LinkedIn to hide your location. You can only provide incorrect information by changing, customizing, or setting a fake location but cannot hide it. By default, Linkedin keeps your profile visible to all. You can change it by following the steps given below:

- 1\. Log in to your LinkedIn profile.
- 2\. Go to settings, click on the "Privacy" tab in the menu.
- 3\. Click on the "Edit your public profile" link.
