<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7SlRcYHpW4"></iframe>



Now that you already know why WhatsApp's live location isn't updating, it's time to check out the solutions. Let's go!

**Step 1. Restart internet connection**

Sometimes, it only takes a simple phone restart to get things back on track. Of course, this will also sort out any bugs in your WhatsApp app. Another thing, you can enable and disable "flight mode" to restart your data connection.

**Step 2. Update the app and phone**

When last did you update your system and apps? You should constantly update your apps and phone system to enjoy better performance and security. It is straightforward!

**Step 3. Enable location service**

You can also check if your location service is enabled on iPhone or Android settings. On iPhone, click Settings > Privacy > Location Service. It's even easier on Android. Swipe down your screen, long-press the GPS button, and enable the Location toggle.

**Step 4. Reset location service on iPhone**

iPhone users can try to reset the Location & Service settings. To do that, open Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy.

**Step 5. Uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp**

If all else fails, then it's probably time to get handy. Simply uninstall your WhatsApp app and then get a newer version on Play Store or App Store. But often, this won't be necessary after updating the app.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.
