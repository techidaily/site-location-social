The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it's okay to share the Location. If you accept, that's how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS.

Cydia offers an app named Location Spoofer. This one is a very good option for those ready/okay with jailbreaking their iPhone devices. You can change the Phone Location iPhone without jailbreak in the previous suggestions, but that is not possible here. This is how you do it -

**Step 1:** Download the Cyndia LocationSpoofer app from their website. You will find LocationSpoofer8 if you are using the iOS 8.0 model.

![cydia app download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic21.jpg)

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic22.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you are sure about your location, change the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic23.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then, right at the end of this bottom line, you will find an 'i' icon. Click on that and then go with the wishlist. There you can choose the apps that can access your virtually changed location. Then Click on 'Done' when you are finished.

The problem with this method is that certain apps downright refuse to function when they detect that you have jailbroken your Motorola G24 Power device. So, keep that in mind when you are making your choice.
