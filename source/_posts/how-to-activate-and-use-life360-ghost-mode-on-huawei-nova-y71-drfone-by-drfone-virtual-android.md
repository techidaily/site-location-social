## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

In 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live Location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the Location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

## Method 1: Spoof Facebook Location on Computer

You can easily fake your Facebook location by spoofing the town or city in the profile settings. This way, anyone who views your profile bio will see your new Facebook location.

So, without wasting much time, here's how to spoof Facebook location on PC:

Step 1. Launch the Facebook app on your web browser and tap your profile icon.

Step 2. Here, click Edit details under the Intro section. After that, you'll land on the Posts window by default.

Step 3. Now tap the **Pencil** icon to change the current city/town. You can also change your hometown, relationship status, and when you joined Facebook.

Step 4. Finally, tap the **Save** button, and Facebook will automatically update your current location. To see if the changes have been applied, tap the **About** tab to see your new profile.

![changing location on facebook settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-01.jpg)

**Note:** Although you can successfully change your bio, Facebook will still access your actual location. Now this means your Facebook recommendations and adverts will still be based on your locality. So, keep reading to learn other reliable ways to spoof your Facebook location.

## Method 2: Change Facebook Location on Android phone

Unlike the strict iPhones, Android allows you to install a third-party app to change the GPS location of your device and Facebook, to be precise. This means you don't need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you'll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US) app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap. Let's see how to do that:

Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.

Step 2. Next, "allow mock locations" in your Android's developer settings. To do that, open **Settings** >**Additional Settings** >**Developer options**. Then, click "**Select mock location app**" before choosing **Fake GPS**.

![fake gps on facebook settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-02.jpg)

Step 3. Now go to the Fake GPS location app and choose a new location for your device. If satisfied, tap **Ok** to save the added area you'd like your device to appear on.

Step 4. Finally, head to Facebook and change your location settings.

## Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook

Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you're in a particular location when in reality, you're not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It's a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.

So, below is **how to fake location on Facebook** with the Check-In feature:

Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the "**What's on your mind**" field.

Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You'll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.

![fake address and tap gps icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg)

Step 3. Now write whatever is on your mind and add the location to your latest post. It's that easy!

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It's an all-in-one software that provides multiple solutions for your Huawei Nova Y71 or Android phone. It allows you to teleport your current location to anywhere in the world without jailbreaking your Huawei Nova Y71 or spending top dollar on a VPN service. This lets you take full advantage of the "Nearby Friends" Facebook feature that needs your actual GPS location.

Below are the key features:

- Transfer phone location to any place in the world.
- Intuitive and detailed zoom-in and zoom-out map.
- Compatible with all iOS and Android versions.
- Move to new locations on the map via different routes and means.
- Compatible with location-based apps like Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
