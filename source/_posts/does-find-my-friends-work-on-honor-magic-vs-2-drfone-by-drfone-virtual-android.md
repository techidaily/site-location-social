Life360 is not just an app; it’s a digital lifeline connecting people with their loved ones. It’s primarily designed for family and close friends. By offering real-time location sharing, it ensures that members of your “Circle” (a group within the app) know where you are at any given moment. This feature is handy for parents monitoring their children’s whereabouts or friends coordinating meet-ups.

### The Purpose of Life360

At its core, Life360 is about safety and connectivity. The app includes features like location history, driving reports, and even crash detection, making it a versatile tool for modern families. It provides several benefits, like:

- **Safety assurance**. Knowing the whereabouts of your loved ones, especially in emergencies, can be invaluable.
- **Convenience**. Planning gatherings or ensuring a family member has arrived safely at a destination becomes more manageable.
- **Emergency response**. The app can alert users to potential emergencies involving Circle members.

### Reasons of Pausing Life360

However, there are instances where learning **how to pause Life360** becomes necessary:

- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.
- **Privacy**. Sometimes, you might want some privacy about your location. Thus, some people would like to pause their Life360 location sharing.

### Methods To Pause Life360 From the App

Now, the question is, **can you pause your location on Life360?** Pausing Life360 can be done for a specific circle or the entire app. This section will show you some general steps to pause your location for the app. You can do it only for a specific circle or the whole app. Here’s how you can do those.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

![location sharing life360 menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-02.jpg)

#### Pausing the Whole App

Regarding this method, pausing the location sharing for all your circles usually involves going through your phone’s **S ettings** and disabling location services for Life360. If you don’t want to do that, you can turn off location sharing for all your circles through the steps provided above.

By understanding and utilizing these features wisely, you can maintain your connection with your loved ones while managing your digital boundaries and battery health effectively. Remember, the aim is to balance connectivity with personal needs.

## Part 2: How To Pause Life360 From Settings

Life360 offers flexibility within its app and through your device’s settings. Understanding how to use these options can provide additional control over location sharing. Explore the various ways **how to pause Life360** outside the app itself.

### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

First, navigate to your Honor Magic Vs 2’s **Settings**. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a **Force Stop** button at the bottom of the screen.

![airplane mode ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-04.jpg)
