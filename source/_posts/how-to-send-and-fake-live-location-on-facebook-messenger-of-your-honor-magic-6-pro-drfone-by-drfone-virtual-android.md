## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Business awareness**

Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

- **Make new friends**

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

You can check out the this video for further instruction.

Here's how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:

**Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.**

![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

On Dr.Fone's home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click **Get Started**. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings > Developer options >USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

## Part 5. FAQ: What People Also Ask about Facebook Location Services

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

### 3\. How can I hide my location on Facebook?

As said earlier, the reason why Facebook gives the wrong location is because of disabled location settings. It's the reverse! So, use this Settings feature to hide your actual location on Facebook.

### Conclusion

Any queries regarding how to send a fake location on Messenger? Let us know if you have any. Meanwhile, use Messenger's inbuilt location feature to share an artificial place with a friend or contact. But because this method only allows you to share fake locations with a single chat, use Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) instead. It's simple, fast, and effective. Are you ready?

## Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?

A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.

If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

## Change Location on Yik Yak For your Honor Magic 6 Pro to Enjoy More Fun

Yik Yak has to be one of the most controversial social media applications. First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.

Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities/states. So keep reading if you've been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today's guide, we will share the best ways to **change the Yik Yak location** and connect with people from different corners of the world.

## Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak

If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here's what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.

Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.

Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.

## Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak

So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone's GPS sensors to detect the current location, you'll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:

### 1\. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities

As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.

However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you'll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won't be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.

### 2\. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location

If you are looking for an effective way to change your location in Yik Yak, we recommend using a professional GPS simulator like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It's a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you'll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.

It means you'll be able to publish your own Yik Yak posts from different locations and react to someone else's posts without interruptions. Apart from Yik Yak, you can also use a tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to manipulate GPS signals in other location-based apps like Pokemon Go or Tinder. It's a great way to meet people from other cities on dating apps, as any geo-restrictions won't bind you.

### _1\. How do you get banned from Yik Yak?_

Since its relaunch, Yik Yak's community guidelines have improved drastically. Now, users have the liberty to downvote any post that they find offensive (in any manner). A post that receives more than 5 downvotes will automatically get removed from the platform, and the account will go under the review stage by the in-house Yik Yak team. The team can then decide whether to block the account or not.

### _2\. Does VPN work with Yik Yak?_

Yes, a VPN can be used with Yik Yak. However, it's not possible to change GPS location with a VPN. For people who don't know, a VPN only changes the IP address of your system and doesn't change the actual GPS location. So if you want to change your GPS location, you'll have to use a dedicated GPS spoofing tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.

### _3\. Can you delete a yak?_

Yes, you can quickly delete any Yak you want on Yik Yak. Yaks are text posts that users publish on the platform. So, as the owner of their posts, they have the power to delete a particular Yak as well. To delete a Yak, all you have to do is tap the “three dots” next to a Yak, click on “More Options,” and then tap the “Delete” button to complete the process.

### Conclusion

Whether you use Yik Yak for fun or have gotten addicted to its anonymity, changing your GPS location on the platform will allow you to expand your social circle and meet strangers from other parts of the world. However, there's no direct way to **change location on Yik Yak**. You'll have to use geo spoofing software such as Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to do the job. The teleport mode feature will make it quite convenient to manipulate your GPS location and access new posts on Yik Yak.
