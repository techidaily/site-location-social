## Part 4. Other Methods To Turn Off Location on Life360

When Ghost Mode feels too troublesome, alternative methods exist to turn off location sharing on Life360 temporarily. Here’s a guide on six different approaches:

### Method 1: Turning Off WiFi and Data

Disabling WiFi and data on Life360 is a common method to prevent location tracking. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

- **Step 1**: Launch Life360 on your phone. Turn off WiFi and data; you can specifically disable them on iPhones for the Life360 app.

Disabling location services provides an effective solution for pausing Life360 without detection, The method applies to both Android and iOS devices. Here’s how:

- **Step 1 (iOS):** Go to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services**. Scroll and find Life360.
- **Step 1 (Android):** Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Life360**.

![turning off life360 location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/ghost-mode-life360-09.jpg)

- **Step 2 (Android):** Tap **Permissions** > **Location**. Choose **Deny** or **Ask every time** to deactivate location access for Life360.
- **Step 2 (iOS):** Tap on it and opt for **Never** to turn off location access for Life360.

### Method 3: Low Data Mode

Disabling WiFi and Data on Life360 might trigger notifications, alerting anyone to your offline status. An alternative method to deactivate Life360 awareness is by using Low Data Mode:

**For iOS**: Open the **Settings** app on your Lava Yuva 2 or iPad. Tap on **Wi-Fi**. Select the **i** icon beside the connected Wi-Fi network. Toggle on the **Low Data Mode** switch.

![turning on low data mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/ghost-mode-life360-10.jpg)

**For Android**: Open the **Settings** app. Scroll and tap on **Cellular** or **Mobile Data**. Tap on **Cellular Data Options** or **Mobile Data Options**. Toggle on the **Low Data Mode** switch.

### Method 4: Turn on Airplane Mode

Activating Airplane Mode deactivates all network connections. It includes GPS, offering a swift solution to cease location sharing on Life360. The action also suspends calls, texts, and internet access, so keep that in mind. Follow the steps:

**For iOS**: Swipe your screen to access the Control Center. Tap the airplane icon to activate **Airplane Mode**. Alternatively, go to **Settings** > **Airplane Mode**. Toggle the switch beside it **On**.

![turning on airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/ghost-mode-life360-11.jpg)

**For Android**: Swipe your screen to access the quick settings menu. Tap the airplane icon to enable **Airplane Mode**. Alternatively, go to **Settings** > **Airplane Mode**. Toggle the switch beside it **On**.

### Method 5: Use a Burner Phone

While it may seem cumbersome, using a burner phone is a straightforward method to disable location sharing on Life360. Install Life360 on the burner phone using the same account. Connect it to the relevant WiFi, and then remove Life360 from your primary device.

### Method 6: Use a VPN Service

Using a VPN service alters your IP address, which can help spoof Life360 to show an inaccurate location. The approach is beneficial when you aim to conceal your location without entirely turning off location sharing. Remember, though, that it’s not foolproof and may not provide consistent results.

## Conclusion

**Life360 Ghost Mode**, though not an official feature, provides a discreet way to enhance privacy within the app. While it’s a valuable tool for moments when you need personal space, be aware of its downsides. If Ghost Mode seems too risky, explore alternative methods.

The ease of enabling Ghost Mode on/off using Dr.Fone makes it a convenient option. Striking the right balance between connectivity and privacy in Life360 requires thoughtful consideration. Explore the dynamics of **Ghost Mode in Life360** to decide if it aligns with your preferences and needs.
