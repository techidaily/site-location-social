Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Lava Blaze 2 Pro to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.

- It’s a workaround to gain an added layer of privacy. It allows you to control the visibility of your real-time location on the Life360 map.
