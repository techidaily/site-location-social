_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

This location sharing App also has a safety feature – all "Glympses" sending your whereabouts to your contacts, however, this automatically expires after a period of time. This means, accidentally you won’t end up broadcasting your location for hours. You can download the

Glympse App from Play Store for Free [http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse&hl=en\_IN](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse&hl=en_IN)
