Changing and setting a customized location on your LinkedIn profile can be beneficial in several ways, as listed below.

1. **Get the job in the new location**: If you are anytime soon planning to relocate to a new location, searching for a new job after reaching the place can be a time-consuming and hassled task.

Moreover, when you update your location before actually moving, you get more time to search for your choice of job.

3. **More job options**: When you update your LinkedIn location, your options for jobs increase, and you become eligible for the jobs which otherwise were not applicable for your location or profile. Thus, access to more job profiles gives you better chances of growing and negotiating.
