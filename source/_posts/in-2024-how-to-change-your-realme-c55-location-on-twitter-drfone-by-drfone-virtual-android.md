### 2.2. Pin a Location in WhatsApp Location Service

#### 2.2.1 Merits & Demerits

#### 2.2.2 How to Pin a Location in WhatsApp

The live location feature is entirely optional, and it depends on whether you want to use it. The process to pin a location is pretty simple. If you want to send a fake location on WhatsApp, then you might need some help. But it is easy to pin your live location.

1\. Launch WhatsApp on your phone and open the chat with the person you want to send your location.

2\. Select the icon that looks like a paperclip and choose the Location option.
