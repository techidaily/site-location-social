### 2.3 Glympse

What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don't even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.

## Why Your WhatsApp Location is Not Updating and How to Fix On HTC U23

WhatsApp is a free messaging app owned by Meta, initially Facebook. Currently, this platform boasts over two billion active users, even outshining Messenger and WeChat. One of the reasons WhatsApp is popular is letting users share their live location with individuals and group chats. However, sometimes you may experience the annoying **WhatsApp location not updating** issue. Luckily, this article has a solution to this problem. We'll also address **how to share my location on the WhatsApp** issue. Let's learn!

## Part 1: Why is WhatsApp Live Location Not Updating?

First and foremost, let's discuss some of the reasons why your **WhatsApp live location is not updating on Android** or iPhone. Below are some of them:

### 1\. Weak internet connection

You should be conversant with the idea that WhatsApp can't function without the internet. In other words, you can't send or receive messages and calls without strong internet. And the same applies to updating your live location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Disabled location feature

Here's another reason why **WhatsApp live location is not updating on iPhone** or Android. While signing up, WhatsApp will request to access your phone's GPS location. Therefore, disabling this feature by mistake can prevent WhatsApp from updating your location.

### 3\. Inappropriate time and date

Although uncommon with modern phones, this can be another reason for a wrong live location on WhatsApp. Therefore, connect your phone to the internet to update your date and time. You might also want to restart your phone and see if it works.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.
