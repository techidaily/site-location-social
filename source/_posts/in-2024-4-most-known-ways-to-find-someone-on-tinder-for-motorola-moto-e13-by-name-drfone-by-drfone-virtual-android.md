The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users.

The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

So, to sum that up, the Location Settings will determine which app gets to access your location and which does not. Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it's okay to share the Location. If you accept, that's how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Motorola Moto E13?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Motorola Moto E13.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Motorola Moto E13, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Motorola Moto E13's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Motorola Moto E13 device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Motorola Moto E13 is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Motorola Moto E13 is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

Basically, it could be extremely hard to remotely install phone surveillance software on an iPhone or Android smartphone without having physical access to the Motorola Moto E13 device in advance.

Anything more than that, and you'd need physical access.

### Q2: Can Someone Spy on You When your Phone is Off?

Sadly yes. According to What Whistleblower Edward Snowden has said in a 2014 interview that the NSA could listen to and spy on conversations using the microphone on a smartphone, even if you turn off your devices.
