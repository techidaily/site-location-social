## Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat

### Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!

### Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?

The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don't have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.

### Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?

Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won't update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.

### Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?

While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone's GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.

### Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile > Settings > See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you'll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You'll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can't find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.

### Wrap it Up

Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can't spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world. This tool also works with other social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Enjoy!
