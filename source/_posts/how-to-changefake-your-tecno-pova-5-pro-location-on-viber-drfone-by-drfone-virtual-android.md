## Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?

So, is it possible to **Viber's fake location**? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.

But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

Now that you know how to spoof location on Viber. Let’s discuss some reasons to spoof location on this messaging app. Below are some common ones:

- **Protect your privacy**

 Many people don’t want other online users to have a clue of their actual whereabouts. If you’re one of them, use a third-party tool to spoof your Viber location on your Tecno Pova 5 Pro or Android.

- **Prank your friends**

Do you want to show your friends that you’re in London or New York when you’re in some remote village/town somewhere in reality? Yes, that sounds cool!

If you’re a digital marketer, you might want to convince your potential clients that the goods are from a specific region or city close to them. Believe it or not, this can lead to more sales closures.

## Part 2: How to Change Your Country to Watch Blocked YouTube Videos?

There are generally no issues when watching YouTube videos anywhere you are. The only instance to have problems accessing YouTube is when you are in a country where the platform is blocked, such as in North Korea or China. Even then, some contents are still geo-restricted unless you're in the right region.

In this part, we're listing five different methods to access YouTube's full library so you can stream all you want.

### Method 1: Change Your Home Area on YouTube Manually

Here are the steps to manually manage your home area on YouTube to change your location.

**Step 1**: Sign up for [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/) and open the YouTube TV application.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![manually change the youtube location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-location-youtube-manual.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click your **Profile Picture** and click **Location** \> **Home Area.**

**Step 3:** Update your home area.

**Note**

You can only change your location twice a year. You should also use YouTube at least once every three months in your country to ensure YouTube TV provides the correct local networks.

### Method 2: Change Location on YouTube Using a VPN

The simplest and most effective way to unblock restricted content on YouTube is by using a VPN. In this example, we'll be using [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/pricing/) to change your location on YouTube using a VPN. Here are the steps.

**Step 1**: Download and install NordVPN. Sign in or create an account.

![use nordvpn to change country youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/nordvpn-signin.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use **Quick Connect** or connect to a specific country by clicking on the pin on the map. You can click on **Search here** as well to find a specific server in the country of your choosing. There's also a list of countries at the left sidebar so you can choose a server manually.

![use nordvpn quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/nordvpn-quick-connect.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open YouTube and browse previously blocked content.

**The Best VPNs for YouTube**

Aside from NordVPN, there are other VPNs you can try to access content on YouTube, including ExpressVPN, CyberGhost, and Surfshark.

[**NordVPN**](https://nordvpn.com/)

NordVPN utilizes up to 5,200 servers in 60 countries, with some servers optimized for ultra-fast streaming. It's one of the fastest VPNs available today, where you can unblock geo-restricted content wherever you are, with a no-logs policy for unbreakable encryption.

[**ExpressVPN**](https://www.expressvpn.com/)

Like NordVPN, ExpressVPN optimizes speed for downloading and streaming. It uses more than 3,000 servers in more than 90 countries to provide cutting-edge connectivity, which includes 256-bit AES encryption for perfect anonymity.

[**CyberGhost**](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/)

CyberGhost has over 7,000 servers in more than 80 countries to unblock geo-restricted content across YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more. CyberGhost doesn't keep logs of your activities as well, ensuring your activity is safe.

[**Surfshark**](https://surfshark.com/)

Lastly, Surfshark is another reliable VPN to unblock restricted content on YouTube and other platforms. It uses up to 3,200 servers in 65 countries to provide a high-speed and low-latency connection at all times. Surfshark has a no-logs policy like the three VPNs on the list, making your online activity safe and anonymous.

Here's a handy table to compare the best VPNs available today in terms of ratings, number of servers, supported devices, prices, and more.

### Method 3: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a Proxy Server

Using a Proxy to mask your location on the internet allows you to change your country on YouTube to access blocked content. In this example, we'll use [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php) to view locked YouTube content. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Go to [ProxFree YouTube Proxy](https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php).

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242" border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![use proxfree youtube proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-proxy.jpg)

**Step 2**: On the **Server Location** dialogue box, choose a country in the available options on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Enter the **URL** of the specific video you want to see unblocked and click **PROXFREE** to open YouTube in the proxy's tab.

![unblock youtube using proxfree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/unblock-youtube-proxfree.jpg)

_**Note**: You can also use YouTube's search bar once YouTube's tab is open on your proxy to search YouTube videos as usual._

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![unblock youtube using smart dns](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/surfshark-smartdns.jpg)

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.
