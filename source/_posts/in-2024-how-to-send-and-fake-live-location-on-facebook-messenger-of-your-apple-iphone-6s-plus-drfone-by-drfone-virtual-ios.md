## How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus

Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here's the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don't even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.

## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Business awareness**

Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

- **Make new friends**

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger

After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let's now know how to do that with easy steps. You don't need third-party help to **mock live locations on Messenger on Android** or iPhone. That's because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:

Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.

Step 2. Click the "four dots" at the bottom-left corner and tap **Location**.

![facebook messenger location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg)

Step 3. Now tap **Allow Location** and choose a new location on the world map that appears.

Step 4. After choosing a location, tap **Send Location** to share it with your selected friend. It's that easy!

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

Here's how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:

**Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.**

![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the "Transfer Files" option.

**Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

On Dr.Fone's home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click **Get Started**. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings > Developer options >USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.

**Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once USB debugging is enabled, press **Next** to launch the map. Now enter your new location's address or GPS coordinates and tap **Move Here**. And there is that!

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

## Part 5. FAQ: What People Also Ask about Facebook Location Services

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

### 3\. How can I hide my location on Facebook?

As said earlier, the reason why Facebook gives the wrong location is because of disabled location settings. It's the reverse! So, use this Settings feature to hide your actual location on Facebook.

### Conclusion

Any queries regarding how to send a fake location on Messenger? Let us know if you have any. Meanwhile, use Messenger's inbuilt location feature to share an artificial place with a friend or contact. But because this method only allows you to share fake locations with a single chat, use Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) instead. It's simple, fast, and effective. Are you ready?

## Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat

### Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!

### Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?

The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don't have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.

### Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?

Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won't update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.

### Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?

While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone's GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.

### Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?

Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile > Settings > See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you'll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You'll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can't find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.

### Wrap it Up

Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can't spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world. This tool also works with other social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Enjoy!
