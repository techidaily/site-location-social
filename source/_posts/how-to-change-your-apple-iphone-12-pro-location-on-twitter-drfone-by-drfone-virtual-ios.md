But, if you know **how to change location on TikTok**, you can surpass all these restrictions easily. The article will help you learn **how to change your TikTok location** by presenting the following aspects:

## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

![dr.fone teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode

Another option is to activate Airplane Mode, severing all connections, including location sharing. Again, this method may alert Circle members to your departure.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle on **Airplane Mode**. The method severs all connections, including location sharing.

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Enable **Battery saving** or **Power saving** mode.

### Method 7: Getting a Burner Phone

Acquiring a secondary, inexpensive phone for Life360 use may be an alternative if all else fails. This method involves monetary considerations and may not be practical for everyone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What if People in the Circle Feel Micromanaged?

Knowing the feeling of being micromanaged, especially among kids and teens, Life360 introduces the Bubble feature. The Bubble feature allows users to set a custom safety zone. It balances monitoring and granting a sense of autonomy within a designated area.

## Conclusion

If you want to know **how to leave a Life360 circle without anyone knowing**, Dr.Fone is recommended as the optimal tool.
