## How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus

Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here's the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don't even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.

## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Business awareness**

Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

- **Make new friends**

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger

After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let's now know how to do that with easy steps. You don't need third-party help to **mock live locations on Messenger on Android** or iPhone. That's because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:

Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.

Step 2. Click the "four dots" at the bottom-left corner and tap **Location**.

![facebook messenger location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg)

Step 3. Now tap **Allow Location** and choose a new location on the world map that appears.

Step 4. After choosing a location, tap **Send Location** to share it with your selected friend. It's that easy!

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

Here's how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:

**Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.**

![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the "Transfer Files" option.

**Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

On Dr.Fone's home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click **Get Started**. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings > Developer options >USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.

**Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once USB debugging is enabled, press **Next** to launch the map. Now enter your new location's address or GPS coordinates and tap **Move Here**. And there is that!

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

## Part 5. FAQ: What People Also Ask about Facebook Location Services

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

### 3\. How can I hide my location on Facebook?

As said earlier, the reason why Facebook gives the wrong location is because of disabled location settings. It's the reverse! So, use this Settings feature to hide your actual location on Facebook.

### Conclusion

Any queries regarding how to send a fake location on Messenger? Let us know if you have any. Meanwhile, use Messenger's inbuilt location feature to share an artificial place with a friend or contact. But because this method only allows you to share fake locations with a single chat, use Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) instead. It's simple, fast, and effective. Are you ready?

## How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Apple iPhone 15 Plus

TikTok is a famous entertainment application that shows exciting content worldwide. It is now a popular application with a recorded 3 billion downloads while surpassing the popularity of Facebook and Twitter in 2018. But, sadly, the application keeps on being the victim of restrictions and bans in different countries worldwide.

This limits content broadcast in different regions, making TikTok lovers deprived of entertainment. But, if you know **how to change location on TikTok**, you can surpass all these restrictions easily. The article will help you learn **how to change your TikTok location** by presenting the following aspects:

## Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location

According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.

If you don't want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.

## Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok

We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to **change location on TikTok:**

- **To Add Diversity to the Audience**

The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.

- **Access Better Content**

Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should **change your location on TikTok** to access unlimited content.

- **Use the App without Hurdles**

Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.

- **Protect your Privacy**

If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.

## Part 3: How to Change your Location in TikTok on Different Devices?
