This location sharing App also has a safety feature – all "Glympses" sending your whereabouts to your contacts, however, this automatically expires after a period of time. This means, accidentally you won’t end up broadcasting your location for hours. You can download the

Glympse App from Play Store for Free [http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse&hl=en\_IN](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse&hl=en_IN)
